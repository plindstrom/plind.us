Thanks to my great neighbors, parts have been flown in, ladders borrowed, problems overcome, heat shields installed and the cabin is warm.  The wood stove works great.

It was really no big deal to have no heat in the cabin for a few days. Stay busy and you stay warm. When not busy add more clothes or go the the neighbor's cabin.

Today some fire wood needs to be cut. There are places along the beach and in the rivers where the currents leave hundreds of logs. The locals are particular about the kind of wood they burn. For now I'm interested in dry wood.

Looking out the window this morning the gulls are feasting on something in the river. Swarms of the birds are hovering over a spot. Then diving down for breakfast.

82,3,2013-05-15 21:50:40,2013-05-16 05:50:40,"MAY 15th. I have been keeping daily notes since May 4th but have not had internet access. Now that I do there are ten days of notes below. In the future there will not be nearly as much volume to read. Thanks for your interest.

MAY 4TH

Much has happened since I was able to add anything to this site. We were supposed to fly out to the cabin on May 1st. The weather was not cooperating so we stayed in Juneau another day. On the 2nd of May we were able to catch a flight to Gustavus and were treated to outstanding hospitality by our pilot and his wife. The clouds and fog were so dense visibility was near zero through a narrow pass called Icy Straights. The fog went all the way down to the surface of the sea….No place to be in a Cessna 206 single engine plane.

On Friday the 3rd. the weather forecast was very iffy. We were not sure when we might be able to get to the cabin. Considering that and a bunch of other details like, “once we get there will Cheryl be able to get out in time to make her connections back home” we decided she should just come on back home and I would make it out to the cabin whenever the weather would allow.

As nature would have it there was a break in weather and a narrow window opened and I got to the cabin about 3:00 Friday afternoon. It was raining. The weather service predicted 100% chance of rain, heavy at times. They were right. It rained, heavy at times, non-stop until 3:00 Saturday afternoon.

I have been spending much of my time just watching the spectacle in front of the cabin. As I type this there are three flocks of migrating birds in my front yard. There are nearly 100 Canada geese just to the left. Directly in front of me there is a flock of 37 Sandhill cranes and a little beyond them must be 50 Snow geese. Throughout the day I have watched this spectacle. Frequently I see a few Greater White-fronted geese mixed in with the others.

&nbsp;

Bald Eagles appear fairly often. You can tell when one is approaching. All the birds feeding take to the air in one huge mass. As soon as the eagle has passed they all come back and resume feeding…right in my front yard.

I’m loving it.

MAY 5TH
Today would have been Mother’s birthday. She wouldn’t have liked it here but would have been happy that I’m able to enjoy all this nature.

It has stopped raining and the clouds are a little higher today. Late in the afternoon I did hear a small plane fly by. That means the weather must be moderating some.

Made good progress getting the outside cleaned up today. Over the years an assortment of plastic and fiberglass articles had accumulated. There were a few alder bushes that were blocking some of the view out the front. I had a heck of a bon fire going for a while. Some of that stuff made really dense black smoke.

Not such a variety of waterfowl out front today. There was a large flock of Canada geese out front late. I’m guessing 250 birds. They graze back and forth less than 100 feet from the front door.

As far as I can tell there is no one else here in the preserve. I check a neighboring cabin to see if their internet connection was working….it wasn’t.

MAY 6TH

Coolest morning yet. Thirty six outside. Forty seven inside. The stove works well and before long I’ll have it up in the middle 60s. There is some blue in the sky and I can see the mountains off in the east. There is beginning to be a tinge of green on the ground and the alders have little buds showing.

Decided to go down to the mouth of the Alsek River to look for glass floats. These baseball size glass balls used to be used to float the fishing nets used by the Japanese fishing off shore. I found a few.

On the way down the beech I saw my first bear of the season. At the mouth of the river a group of sea lions had gathered. The herd bull would frequently bellow or roar his presence. There seemed to be many young seals there too.

MAY 7TH

A beautiful blue sky morning with no wind. The heavy frost is quickly disappearing in the warm sunshine. Not many birds on the ground out front. It is unusual to look up into the sky and not see flocks of birds all heading the same way… North. As I type this an Osprey landed out front. The first humming bird just flew by. Got to get a feeder for them! Those sea lions mentioned yesterday…They are several miles away and I can hear them roaring here at the cabin.

Borrowed a neighbor’s hummingbird feeder. They are not here yet so I didn’t think they would mind. I put the feeder up about ten this morning. By noon several pairs had found it. All the hummers I have seen up here are the Rufous hummingbirds. We see them passing through Colorado in July.

I met another resident yesterday. I spent most of the day working on the storage area of the cabin. Hearing a little noise I discovered an Ermine (weasel) watching me. I hope she appreciates the redecorating.

Also discovered the freezer freezes and the washing machine washes.

MAY 8th
A little chilly this morning, 30 outside and 40 inside. Another beautiful morning. I was up around 4:15. The hummingbirds were already buzzing around outside wondering where their feeder was!

My neighbor flew down from Yakutat. He brought all the stuff I need to get the internet connection set up. He also brought provisions to begin stocking their cabin. He flew back to town and will return tomorrow with more supplies for his cabin. He will also bring the things to install the wood stove. I have been heating with an oil stove. With an endless supply of free fuel outside it seems silly to buy oil then have to fly it in.

While we were standing outside another resident came up from out of the woods. It was a fair size brown bear (grizzly). He went back into the brush before I could get some good close-up pictures.

MAY 9th

High human traffic today. The neighbor flew back in with a friend of his. He brought all the parts needed to install the wood stove. Now I have to decide if I want to use the old wood stove that was stored here or get a new one. It’s not only the cost of the stove but getting it here will be expensive too. A pilot we flew with last year stopped by. He had been delivering fuel to a bear hunter’s camp. He was flying a neat little “cub” that had skis attached just above the wheels. He could land on the beach or in the snow. A little later two of the guides from the bear hunter camp stopped. Whew! I didn’t get as much work done as I hoped.

Did get the attic emptied out. There was some high quality outdoor gear up there.

A couple of wildlife things. The hummers are drinking over a quart of food a day. The weasel was back in the cabin last night. I nearly swatted him with my cap as it scurried across the floor.

MAY 10th

Last night I installed new gaskets in the hand pump by the sink. Whenever I needed more water I had to pump that handle at least 50 times (I actually counted). This morning on the 7th stroke water appeared. That is so neat. To not have to work up a sweat to get a cup of water.

My neighbor has a portable saw mill. It comes in heal handy when you need more than a couple of boards that could be flown in on a small plane. Yesterday he found a fir log down on the beach over 40 feet long. Today we went down there, cut the log into 2 twenty footers rolled them onto an ingenious trailer and brought that huge log home to be sawed up into boards.

This afternoon we got all the internet hardware mounted on the house and the wiring done. I still don’t have a connection to the internet. We think it is because there are some trees blocking the clear view of the sky the satellite dish needs. So tomorrow I’ll be turning trees into firewood.

MAY 11th
I went down to the mouth of the Alsek this morning to do a little more beachcombing. Found one glass float that had appeared with the tide. A little later my neighbor stopped in. He had also gone down there. He found another glass float not twenty feet from where I found mine. I expect I was so pleased to find one I didn’t bother to look around for another so close.

The alder trees grow so quickly here they encroach on any clear space. So over the years they had invaded the space around the cabin clearing. I had been trimming them back for several days. Yesterday I spent quite a while burning them.

Nearby, the little weasel was very busy hunting for something.

My neighbor and his friend flew back to Yakutat around noon. He left the dog, Charlie, with me for the night. There had been a very light rain falling most of the day. When I went to bed it was pitch black inside. A little while later I could sense something very close. I turned on the light and Charlie was staring at me from a few inches away. Needless to say she wanted to be up off the floor. As far as I know she didn’t move all night….a good bed mate.

MAY 12th

I woke up this morning feeling an empty place. This is the first Mother’s Day in all these years that I have not been able to wish someone Happy Mother’s Day. To those Mothers who might read this …I hope you had a happy Mother’s Day.

A light rain has fallen all day. So, very major progress was made today on organizing the living space at the cabin. By the end of the week I hope to have a wood stove working, the shop side of the cabin organized and the internet working.

The rainy day has caused the humming birds to spend what seems like most of their time around the feeder. I filled the quart feeder after the birds went to bed last night. By 1:00 p.m. it was empty. It is nearly 8:30 p.m. now and I can’t see any food in it. They will have consumed over one half gallon of sugar water today.

Charlie, the neighbor’s bear dog, is still with me. I get to keep her until the weather clears and the neighbors can get back down here. Thanks to Charlie’s being on guard she alerted me to a moose just across the river this morning. We watched her for a while till she crossed to our side and disappeared into the brush.

MAY 13th

About 12:30 this morning Charlie started having a fit. I grabbed a flashlight and let her out. She kept running around the outside of the cabin. The little LED flashlight didn’t help much in finding out what was out there. About a half hour later she was still very agitated. When I called her she came in and we settled down for the rest of the night.

About 6:30 she started up again. I thought that is a lot of baking for the little weasel. Now Charlie was going under the cabin sounding more aggressive than ever. As I came back into the shop an Otter disappeared into a space along the wall. There turned out to be two otters. Between Charlie and I giving them so much grief they have moved on to a quieter spot.

Good progress was made on cleaning up the accumulated stuff today. It rained on and off most of the day. Tomorrow if the weather cooperates I might start preparing to install the woodstove. I’m almost out of heating oil.

MAY 14th

Charlie got the morning off to good start for herself. She caught a sea gull out in front.

I did get started on preparing for the wood stove. The cabin has a plywood floor. Some time back the previous owner bought some laminate flooring but didn’t get a chance to install it. I got about half the floor done today. It didn’t go down nearly as easily as the last time I worked with that kind of flooring. Maybe sitting around in high humidity for several years had something to do with it. Anyway, now that the floor is finished under where the wood stove will be I can proceed to figure out to protect the floor and wall from the heat it will put out. I’m fairly motivated in that I am out of heating oil.

It was another rainy day. Fog came and went through the day. No small planes were flying. Because I am so near the ocean the temperatures stay very even. On a cloudy day like today the low might be 42 and the high for the day 48. All I have to do to stay warm is stay busy. Otherwise it requires several layers.

Since I have no radio and no internet I don’t know what the forecast is. Sometimes my little weather station shows the pressure going up. That means fair weather ahead. Then it changes its mind.

MAY 15th

The friends who are also neighbors arrived today. Three trips in the plane from Yakutat to get their cabins stocked for the season. Dinner with them this evening featured Beer Batter halibut for an appetizer. Meatloaf and red potatoes, fresh salad. All this was accompanied by great conversation and Buffalo Trace bourbon. It was a great meal.

I got the internet working late this morning. Now I can begin to learn how post pictures on this site so they are not upside down.

We got the outside chimney installed for the wood stove. I should have heat in the cabin tomorrow before noon.",MAY 15th,,publish,open,open,,may-15th,,,2013-10-22 08:27:23,2013-10-22 16:27:23,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=82,0,post,,5

He could land on the beach or in the snow. A little later two of the guides from the bear hunter camp stopped. Whew! I didn’t get as much work done as I hoped.

Did get the attic emptied out. There was some high quality outdoor gear up there.

A couple of wildlife things. The hummers are drinking over a quart of food a day. The weasel was back in the cabin last night. I nearly swatted him with my cap as it scurried across the floor.

MAY 10th

Last night I installed new gaskets in the hand pump by the sink. Whenever I needed more water I had to pump that handle at least 50 times (I actually counted). This morning on the 7th stroke water appeared. That is so neat. To not have to work up a sweat to get a cup of water.

My neighbor has a portable saw mill. It comes in heal handy when you need more than a couple of boards that could be flown in on a small plane. Yesterday he found a fir log down on the beach over 40 feet long. Today we went down there, cut the log into 2 twenty footers rolled them onto an ingenious trailer and brought that huge log home to be sawed up into boards.

This afternoon we got all the internet hardware mounted on the house and the wiring done. I still don’t have a connection to the internet. We think it is because there are some trees blocking the clear view of the sky the satellite dish needs. So tomorrow I’ll be turning trees into firewood.

MAY 11th
I went down to the mouth of the Alsek this morning to do a little more beachcombing. Found one glass float that had appeared with the tide. A little later my neighbor stopped in. He had also gone down there. He found another glass float not twenty feet from where I found mine. I expect I was so pleased to find one I didn’t bother to look around for another so close.

The alder trees grow so quickly here they encroach on any clear space. So over the years they had invaded the space around the cabin clearing. I had been trimming them back for several days. Yesterday I spent quite a while burning them.

Nearby, the little weasel was very busy hunting for something.

My neighbor and his friend flew back to Yakutat around noon. He left the dog, Charlie, with me for the night. There had been a very light rain falling most of the day. When I went to bed it was pitch black inside. A little while later I could sense something very close. I turned on the light and Charlie was staring at me from a few inches away. Needless to say she wanted to be up off the floor. As far as I know she didn’t move all night….a good bed mate.

MAY 12th

I woke up this morning feeling an empty place. This is the first Mother’s Day in all these years that I have not been able to wish someone Happy Mother’s Day. To those Mothers who might read this …I hope you had a happy Mother’s Day.

A light rain has fallen all day. So, very major progress was made today on organizing the living space at the cabin. By the end of the week I hope to have a wood stove working, the shop side of the cabin organized and the internet working.

The rainy day has caused the humming birds to spend what seems like most of their time around the feeder. I filled the quart feeder after the birds went to bed last night. By 1:00 p.m. it was empty. It is nearly 8:30 p.m. now and I can’t see any food in it. They will have consumed over one half gallon of sugar water today.

Charlie, the neighbor’s bear dog, is still with me. I get to keep her until the weather clears and the neighbors can get back down here. Thanks to Charlie’s being on guard she alerted me to a moose just across the river this morning. We watched her for a while till she crossed to our side and disappeared into the brush.

MAY 13th

About 12:30 this morning Charlie started having a fit. I grabbed a flashlight and let her out. She kept running around the outside of the cabin. The little LED flashlight didn’t help much in finding out what was out there. About a half hour later she was still very agitated. When I called her she came in and we settled down for the rest of the night.

About 6:30 she started up again. I thought that is a lot of baking for the little weasel. Now Charlie was going under the cabin sounding more aggressive than ever. As I came back into the shop an Otter disappeared into a space along the wall. I bet it looked funny me sitting in a plastic chair, gun across my lap sipping coffee. Charlie did her job and the otter came out for the last time.

Now there seems to be yet another otter under there. I shot at it but it slipped back under the floor. Time and smell will tell if I hit it.

Good progress was made on cleaning up the accumulated stuff today. It rained on and off most of the day. Tomorrow if the weather cooperates I might start preparing to install the woodstove. I’m almost out of heating oil.

MAY 14th

Charlie got the morning off to good start for herself. She caught a sea gull out in front.

I did get started on preparing for the wood stove. The cabin has a plywood floor. Some time back the previous owner bought some laminate flooring but didn’t get a chance to install it. I got about half the floor done today. It didn’t go down nearly as easily as the last time I worked with that kind of flooring. Maybe sitting around in high humidity for several years had something to do with it. Anyway, now that the floor is finished under where the wood stove will be I can proceed to figure out to protect the floor and wall from the heat it will put out. I’m fairly motivated in that I am out of heating oil.

It was another rainy day. Fog came and went through the day. No small planes were flying. Because I am so near the ocean the temperatures stay very even. On a cloudy day like today the low might be 42 and the high for the day 48. All I have to do to stay warm is stay busy. Otherwise it requires several layers.

Since I have no radio and no internet I don’t know what the forecast is. Sometimes my little weather station shows the pressure going up. That means fair weather ahead. Then it changes its mind.

MAY 15th

The friends who are also neighbors arrived today. Three trips in the plane from Yakutat to get their cabins stocked for the season. Dinner with them this evening featured Beer Batter halibut for an appetizer. Meatloaf and red potatoes, fresh salad. All this was accompanied by great conversation and Buffalo Trace bourbon. It was a great meal.

I got the internet working late this morning. Now I can begin to learn how post pictures on this site so they are not upside down.

We got the outside chimney installed for the wood stove. I should have heat in the cabin tomorrow before noon.",,,inherit,open,open,,82-revision-v1,,,2013-05-15 21:49:22,2013-05-16 05:49:22,,82,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/05/15/82-revision/,0,revision,,0

MAY 4TH

Much has happened since I was able to add anything to this site. We were supposed to fly out to the cabin on May 1st. The weather was not cooperating so we stayed in Juneau another day. On the 2nd of May we were able to catch a flight to Gustavus and were treated to outstanding hospitality by our pilot and his wife. The clouds and fog were so dense visibility was near zero through a narrow pass called Icy Straights. The fog went all the way down to the surface of the sea….No place to be in a Cessna 206 single engine plane.

On Friday the 3rd. the weather forecast was very iffy. We were not sure when we might be able to get to the cabin. Considering that and a bunch of other details like, “once we get there will Cheryl be able to get out in time to make her connections back home” we decided she should just come on back home and I would make it out to the cabin whenever the weather would allow.

As nature would have it there was a break in weather and a narrow window opened and I got to the cabin about 3:00 Friday afternoon. It was raining. The weather service predicted 100% chance of rain, heavy at times. They were right. It rained, heavy at times, non-stop until 3:00 Saturday afternoon.

I have been spending much of my time just watching the spectacle in front of the cabin. As I type this there are three flocks of migrating birds in my front yard. There are nearly 100 Canada geese just to the left. Directly in front of me there is a flock of 37 Sandhill cranes and a little beyond them must be 50 Snow geese. Throughout the day I have watched this spectacle. Frequently I see a few Greater White-fronted geese mixed in with the others.

Bald Eagles appear fairly often. You can tell when one is approaching. All the birds feeding take to the air in one huge mass. As soon as the eagle has passed they all come back and resume feeding…right in my front yard.

I’m loving it.

MAY 5TH
Today would have been Mother’s birthday. She wouldn’t have liked it here but would have been happy that I’m able to enjoy all this nature.

It has stopped raining and the clouds are a little higher today. Late in the afternoon I did hear a small plane fly by. That means the weather must be moderating some.

Made good progress getting the outside cleaned up today. Over the years an assortment of plastic and fiberglass articles had accumulated. There were a few alder bushes that were blocking some of the view out the front. I had a heck of a bon fire going for a while. Some of that stuff made really dense black smoke.

Not such a variety of waterfowl out front today. There was a large flock of Canada geese out front late. I’m guessing 250 birds. They graze back and forth less than 100 feet from the front door.

As far as I can tell there is no one else here in the preserve. I check a neighboring cabin to see if their internet connection was working….it wasn’t.

MAY 6TH

Coolest morning yet. Thirty six outside. Forty seven inside. The stove works well and before long I’ll have it up in the middle 60s. There is some blue in the sky and I can see the mountains off in the east. There is beginning to be a tinge of green on the ground and the alders have little buds showing.

Decided to go down to the mouth of the Alsek River to look for glass floats. These baseball size glass balls used to be used to float the fishing nets used by the Japanese fishing off shore. I found a few.

On the way down the beech I saw my first bear of the season. At the mouth of the river a group of sea lions had gathered. The herd bull would frequently bellow or roar his presence. There seemed to be many young seals there too.

MAY 7TH

A beautiful blue sky morning with no wind. The heavy frost is quickly disappearing in the warm sunshine. Not many birds on the ground out front. It is unusual to look up into the sky and not see flocks of birds all heading the same way… North. As I type this an Osprey landed out front. The first humming bird just flew by. Got to get a feeder for them! Those sea lions mentioned yesterday…They are several miles away and I can hear them roaring here at the cabin.

Borrowed a neighbor’s hummingbird feeder. They are not here yet so I didn’t think they would mind. I put the feeder up about ten this morning. By noon several pairs had found it. All the hummers I have seen up here are the Rufous hummingbirds. We see them passing through Colorado in July.

I met another resident yesterday. I spent most of the day working on the storage area of the cabin. Hearing a little noise I discovered an Ermine (weasel) watching me. I hope she appreciates the redecorating.

Also discovered the freezer freezes and the washing machine washes.

MAY 8th
A little chilly this morning, 30 outside and 40 inside. Another beautiful morning. I was up around 4:15. The hummingbirds were already buzzing around outside wondering where their feeder was!

My neighbor flew down from Yakutat. He brought all the stuff I need to get the internet connection set up. He also brought provisions to begin stocking their cabin. He flew back to town and will return tomorrow with more supplies for his cabin. He will also bring the things to install the wood stove. I have been heating with an oil stove. With an endless supply of free fuel outside it seems silly to buy oil then have to fly it in.

While we were standing outside another resident came up from out of the woods. It was a fair size brown bear (grizzly). He went back into the brush before I could get some good close-up pictures.

MAY 9th

High human traffic today. The neighbor flew back in with a friend of his. He brought all the parts needed to install the wood stove. Now I have to decide if I want to use the old wood stove that was stored here or get a new one. It’s not only the cost of the stove but getting it here will be expensive too. A pilot we flew with last year stopped by. He had been delivering fuel to a bear hunter’s camp. He was flying a neat little “cub” that had skis attached just above the wheels.

It was really no big deal to have no heat in the cabin for a few days. Stay busy and you stay warm. When not busy add more clothes or go the the neighbor's cabin.

Today some fire wood needs to be cut. There are places along the beach and in the rivers where the currents leave hundreds of logs. The locals are particular about the kind of wood they burn. For now I'm interested in dry wood.

Borrowed a neighbor’s hummingbird feeder. They are not here yet so I didn’t think they would mind. I put the feeder up about ten this morning. By noon several pairs had found it. All the hummers I have seen up here are the Rufous hummingbirds. We see them passing through Colorado in July.

I met another resident yesterday. I spent most of the day working on the storage area of the cabin. Hearing a little noise I discovered an Ermine (weasel) watching me. I hope she appreciates the redecorating.

Also discovered the freezer freezes and the washing machine washes.

MAY 8th
A little chilly this morning, 30 outside and 40 inside. Another beautiful morning. I was up around 4:15. The hummingbirds were already buzzing around outside wondering where their feeder was!

My neighbor flew down from Yakutat. He brought all the stuff I need to get the internet connection set up. He also brought provisions to begin stocking their cabin. He flew back to town and will return tomorrow with more supplies for his cabin. He will also bring the things to install the wood stove. I have been heating with an oil stove. With an endless supply of free fuel outside it seems silly to buy oil then have to fly it in.

While we were standing outside another resident came up from out of the woods. It was a fair size brown bear (grizzly). He went back into the brush before I could get some good close-up pictures.

MAY 9th

High human traffic today. The neighbor flew back in with a friend of his. He brought all the parts needed to install the wood stove. Now I have to decide if I want to use the old wood stove that was stored here or get a new one. It’s not only the cost of the stove but getting it here will be expensive too. A pilot we flew with last year stopped by. He had been delivering fuel to a bear hunter’s camp. He was flying a neat little “cub” that had skis attached just above the wheels. He could land on the beach or in the snow. A little later two of the guides from the bear hunter camp stopped. Whew! I didn’t get as much work done as I hoped.

Did get the attic emptied out. There was some high quality outdoor gear up there.

A couple of wildlife things. The hummers are drinking over a quart of food a day. The weasel was back in the cabin last night. I nearly swatted him with my cap as it scurried across the floor.

MAY 10th

Last night I installed new gaskets in the hand pump by the sink. Whenever I needed more water I had to pump that handle at least 50 times (I actually counted). This morning on the 7th stroke water appeared. That is so neat. To not have to work up a sweat to get a cup of water.

My neighbor has a portable saw mill. It comes in heal handy when you need more than a couple of boards that could be flown in on a small plane. Yesterday he found a fir log down on the beach over 40 feet long. Today we went down there, cut the log into 2 twenty footers rolled them onto an ingenious trailer and brought that huge log home to be sawed up into boards.

This afternoon we got all the internet hardware mounted on the house and the wiring done. I still don’t have a connection to the internet. We think it is because there are some trees blocking the clear view of the sky the satellite dish needs. So tomorrow I’ll be turning trees into firewood.

MAY 11th
I went down to the mouth of the Alsek this morning to do a little more beachcombing. Found one glass float that had appeared with the tide. A little later my neighbor stopped in. He had also gone down there. He found another glass float not twenty feet from where I found mine. I expect I was so pleased to find one I didn’t bother to look around for another so close.

The alder trees grow so quickly here they encroach on any clear space. So over the years they had invaded the space around the cabin clearing. I had been trimming them back for several days. Yesterday I spent quite a while burning them.

Nearby, the little weasel was very busy hunting for something.

My neighbor and his friend flew back to Yakutat around noon. He left the dog, Charlie, with me for the night. There had been a very light rain falling most of the day. When I went to bed it was pitch black inside. A little while later I could sense something very close. I turned on the light and Charlie was staring at me from a few inches away. Needless to say she wanted to be up off the floor. As far as I know she didn’t move all night….a good bed mate.

MAY 12th

I woke up this morning feeling an empty place. This is the first Mother’s Day in all these years that I have not been able to wish someone Happy Mother’s Day. To those Mothers who might read this …I hope you had a happy Mother’s Day.

A light rain has fallen all day. So, very major progress was made today on organizing the living space at the cabin. By the end of the week I hope to have a wood stove working, the shop side of the cabin organized and the internet working.

The rainy day has caused the humming birds to spend what seems like most of their time around the feeder. I filled the quart feeder after the birds went to bed last night. By 1:00 p.m. it was empty. It is nearly 8:30 p.m. now and I can’t see any food in it. They will have consumed over one half gallon of sugar water today.

Charlie, the neighbor’s bear dog, is still with me. I get to keep her until the weather clears and the neighbors can get back down here. Thanks to Charlie’s being on guard she alerted me to a moose just across the river this morning. We watched her for a while till she crossed to our side and disappeared into the brush.

MAY 13th

About 12:30 this morning Charlie started having a fit. I grabbed a flashlight and let her out. She kept running around the outside of the cabin. The little LED flashlight didn’t help much in finding out what was out there. About a half hour later she was still very agitated. When I called her she came in and we settled down for the rest of the night.

About 6:30 she started up again. I thought that is a lot of baking for the little weasel. Now Charlie was going under the cabin sounding more aggressive than ever. As I came back into the shop an Otter disappeared into a space along the wall. There turned out to be two otters.  Between Charlie and I giving them so much grief they have moved on to probably a quieter 

Good progress was made on cleaning up the accumulated stuff today. It rained on and off most of the day. Tomorrow if the weather cooperates I might start preparing to install the woodstove. I’m almost out of heating oil.

MAY 14th

Charlie got the morning off to good start for herself. She caught a sea gull out in front.

I did get started on preparing for the wood stove. The cabin has a plywood floor. Some time back the previous owner bought some laminate flooring but didn’t get a chance to install it. I got about half the floor done today. It didn’t go down nearly as easily as the last time I worked with that kind of flooring. Maybe sitting around in high humidity for several years had something to do with it. Anyway, now that the floor is finished under where the wood stove will be I can proceed to figure out to protect the floor and wall from the heat it will put out. I’m fairly motivated in that I am out of heating oil.

It was another rainy day. Fog came and went through the day. No small planes were flying. Because I am so near the ocean the temperatures stay very even. On a cloudy day like today the low might be 42 and the high for the day 48. All I have to do to stay warm is stay busy. Otherwise it requires several layers.

Since I have no radio and no internet I don’t know what the forecast is. Sometimes my little weather station shows the pressure going up. That means fair weather ahead. Then it changes its mind.

MAY 15th

The friends who are also neighbors arrived today. Three trips in the plane from Yakutat to get their cabins stocked for the season. Dinner with them this evening featured Beer Batter halibut for an appetizer. Meatloaf and red potatoes, fresh salad. All this was accompanied by great conversation and Buffalo Trace bourbon. It was a great meal.

I got the internet working late this morning. Now I can begin to learn how post pictures on this site so they are not upside down.

We got the outside chimney installed for the wood stove. I should have heat in the cabin tomorrow before noon.",MAY 15th,,inherit,open,open,,82-autosave-v1,,,2013-05-21 07:06:48,2013-05-21 15:06:48,,82,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/05/21/82-autosave/,0,revision,,0

MAY 4TH

Much has happened since I was able to add anything to this site. We were supposed to fly out to the cabin on May 1st. The weather was not cooperating so we stayed in Juneau another day. On the 2nd of May we were able to catch a flight to Gustavus and were treated to outstanding hospitality by our pilot and his wife. The clouds and fog were so dense visibility was near zero through a narrow pass called Icy Straights. The fog went all the way down to the surface of the sea….No place to be in a Cessna 206 single engine plane.

On Friday the 3rd. the weather forecast was very iffy. We were not sure when we might be able to get to the cabin. Considering that and a bunch of other details like, “once we get there will Cheryl be able to get out in time to make her connections back home” we decided she should just come on back home and I would make it out to the cabin whenever the weather would allow.

As nature would have it there was a break in weather and a narrow window opened and I got to the cabin about 3:00 Friday afternoon. It was raining. The weather service predicted 100% chance of rain, heavy at times. They were right. It rained, heavy at times, non-stop until 3:00 Saturday afternoon.

I have been spending much of my time just watching the spectacle in front of the cabin. As I type this there are three flocks of migrating birds in my front yard. There are nearly 100 Canada geese just to the left. Directly in front of me there is a flock of 37 Sandhill cranes and a little beyond them must be 50 Snow geese. Throughout the day I have watched this spectacle. Frequently I see a few Greater White-fronted geese mixed in with the others.

Bald Eagles appear fairly often. You can tell when one is approaching. All the birds feeding take to the air in one huge mass. As soon as the eagle has passed they all come back and resume feeding…right in my front yard.

I’m loving it.

MAY 5TH
Today would have been Mother’s birthday. She wouldn’t have liked it here but would have been happy that I’m able to enjoy all this nature.

It has stopped raining and the clouds are a little higher today. Late in the afternoon I did hear a small plane fly by. That means the weather must be moderating some.

Made good progress getting the outside cleaned up today. Over the years an assortment of plastic and fiberglass articles had accumulated. There were a few alder bushes that were blocking some of the view out the front. I had a heck of a bon fire going for a while. Some of that stuff made really dense black smoke.

Not such a variety of waterfowl out front today. There was a large flock of Canada geese out front late. I’m guessing 250 birds. They graze back and forth less than 100 feet from the front door.

As far as I can tell there is no one else here in the preserve. I check a neighboring cabin to see if their internet connection was working….it wasn’t.

MAY 6TH

Coolest morning yet. Thirty six outside. Forty seven inside. The stove works well and before long I’ll have it up in the middle 60s. There is some blue in the sky and I can see the mountains off in the east. There is beginning to be a tinge of green on the ground and the alders have little buds showing.

Decided to go down to the mouth of the Alsek River to look for glass floats. These baseball size glass balls used to be used to float the fishing nets used by the Japanese fishing off shore. I found a few.

On the way down the beech I saw my first bear of the season. At the mouth of the river a group of sea lions had gathered. The herd bull would frequently bellow or roar his presence. There seemed to be many young seals there too.

MAY 7TH

A beautiful blue sky morning with no wind. The heavy frost is quickly disappearing in the warm sunshine. Not many birds on the ground out front. It is unusual to look up into the sky and not see flocks of birds all heading the same way… North. As I type this an Osprey landed out front. The first humming bird just flew by.

Now there seems to be yet another otter under there. I shot at it but it slipped back under the floor. Time and smell will tell if I hit it.

The morning, northbound, flight originates in Seattle, stops in Juneau, Yakutat, Cordova and ends in Anchorage. That same plane turns around, southbound, and makes those same stops on the way back to Seattle. I had a very busy morning getting a lot of shopping done for the cabin and caught the southbound back to Yakutat.

It was clear all the way from Anchorage. I sat on the left side of the plane so I could see the continuous mountain ranges below. They all still have snow on them down to about 1,000 feet. As these warm days come more often one can see the snow line rise up the mountains each day. Between Anchorage and the cabin there must be at least 50 coastal glaciers. The rivers that flow from them to the sea are all a light gray color from the silt created by the glacier as it grinds across the stones. Those rivers all have icebergs in them. Some the size of garbage cans. Some appear to be as big as city blocks. The ice sheet at the head of some of these glaciers is the largest in North America. To see all that white snow and ice then land at the cabin which sits in a temperate rain forest....we live on an amazing planet.

Neighbor, Harold met me at the airport and we flew on down to the cabin in his plane. The ghost of my extracted tooth was haunting me so I took some medicine to chase it away. The weasel was here and greeted me with some news. There is clear plastic stapled to the ceiling joists that holds the insulation up. I could see the weasel moving around on top of the clear plastic but below the insulation. As I watched I noticed some more movement above the plastic.
She had a litter of little weasels up there. Harold's grandson and his girlfriend came over to see the litter. Harold's son, Pat, wanted me to catch the weasels and put them in another neighbor's house. I decided not to do that.

We positioned a deep Rubbermaid tub under the nest and cut the plastic around the nest. The seven little weasels and the mother weasel all fell into the tub. We took them about a hundred yards from the cabin and turned the tub on its side. Out pops mom with a little weasel in her mouth. She ran into the woods with it. We left her alone and in maybe 15 minutes she had moved all seven of her pups(?) to some other place.

We took them about a hundred yards from the cabin and turned the tub on its side. Out pops mom with a little weasel in her mouth. She ran into the woods with it. We left her alone and in maybe 15 minutes she had moved all seven of her pups(?) to some other place.

I came back from Anchorage with the parts to install another well. This one will have an electric pump attached. There may be running water at the cabin soon. More about that another time.

Thanks for the kind comments about these ramblings. I enjoy telling these stories.",May 21st,,inherit,open,open,,96-autosave-v1,,,2013-10-21 12:11:57,2013-10-21 20:11:57,,96,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/05/21/96-autosave/,0,revision,,0

I made some progress getting the loft area of the cabin ready to remodel.  A couple of the neighbors have this saw mill I think was mentioned earlier.  The lumber I need for the modifications I want to make they will cut for me.  It's pretty neat.  If you need ten 2x4s just go out and make them.  Need a couple of 2x6 boards.. No problem.  I mentioned having some paneling flown in.  Pat looked at me and said "" why not use some one by six boards?  We will just make them.""  With that machine who needs a lumber yard?

Behind the cabin there is an old gravel runway.  It was built so the planes carrying the fish to the processors had a place to land.  It isn't used for that anymore.  These days the planes just land on the beach in front of the cabin.  The runway is kept trimmed by the people who live along side it.  It is lined on both sides by trees.  Tonight I was invited to a hot dog roast on the runway.  It was out of that west wind and a central place for those of us who are here could gather.

It was at the hot dog roast that I was informed on my first BIG mistake.  I had gone to the city and had returned with no beer.  Didn't matter that I Already had four bags to check.  Didn't matter that another checked bag would cost an additional $50.00.  It seems that if you are going to live in this small close knit community when you go ""outside"" you bring back some beer.

Last week at this time there were so many hummingbirds that one day they drank 3/4 of a gallon of sugar water in one day.  While I was in Anchorage the feeder ran out of food for them.  I filled it up again this morning.  All day I saw only two hummingbirds.  I guess they have moved on to wherever it is they go.   Spring is about to pop here.  I was told if I wanted to go exploring in the woods I'd better do it soon.  When the leaves start to come out it happens all at once.  There is so much daylight.  Only about four hours of each night are truly dark.  It is light outside when I go to bed and at four in morning the birds are already up and busy.

104,3,2013-05-25 19:54:14,2013-05-26 03:54:14,"Yesterday I was so worn out by the time I usually write things here I just couldn't.  

Ths morning munching on my Grape Nuts I noticed something moving over on the other side of the river.  A brown bear and her two cubs were foraging along the river bank. The cubs were almost as big as the sow.  It was fun to watch them.  They were very curious.  Together the cubs inspected the roots of a tree that had washed up on the bank.  One would move ahead of mom while the other one tended to lag behind.  Mom would frequently look around, checking on each cub, then go back to foraging.  From time to time she would look across the river toward the cabin.  I expect she has experience with the humans who live over here.  She kept her distance and is hopefully teaching her cubs to do the same.

I did four loads of laundry today.  It takes four and a half 5 gallon buckets of water for the wash cycle and another four and a half buckets for the rinse cycle.  I get my water from a well connected to a hand pump installed over the kitchen sink.  It takes forty strokes on the hand pump to fill each bucket.  That is 36 buckets of water for the four loads.  That is 1,440 strokes on that pump to get the clothes washed.  I got to get the electric pump going!  The washing machine is in the garage.  The first time I used it I caught the water expelled from the washer in buckets.  That was s sight to see.  The washer spitting out gallons of water nonstop and me switching buckets trying to not flood the garage.  The solution this time was to patch together some plastic pipe pieces.  Now the washer's hose goes into the first piece of plastic pipe.  Held there with duct tape.  That gets me out the garage door.  With fittings I can add more short pieces of pipe to get the wash water away from the garage.

I am going to have a few visitors this summer.  To accommodate them I felt I needed for them to have a separate sleeping space.  The garage side of the cabin has a 12 foot high ceiling that slopes down to about 7 on the outside wall.  Today I built a loft over part of that space.  I made the floor high enough so the space under the loft is still useable.  The ceiling in part of the loft is too low to do more than store things there.  That space will be just right for some of the seldom used garage stuff.

Tomorrow is my oldest son's birthday.  He will visit me here later this summer.  In the mean time I wish him much joy and happiness and lots of Amazon gift cards.  

In his honor I might cross the river again and do some beach combing.  A neighbor told me how to get the four wheeler across.  When the water gets too deep to ride the machine, just get off and float it on across to shallower water.  I can see how the four wheeler can float but I think I'll tie a rope to it in case it gets away from me.

The low tide tomorrow morning is almost 3 feet lower than normal.  I will have to watch how much time I spend on the other side.  After the low tide the water comes back in.  I don't want to have to wait over there for the next low tide.

I had planned to cross the river with the four wheeler this morning.  If the water was to deep the plan was to get off and float the wheeler into shallower water.  The lowest tide of the month was this morning.  What I didn't know was last night the third highest tide of the month had come in.  All that water gets pushed up into the rivers.  Even though there was a very low tide all the water pushed into the river was trying to get out.

It still hasn't moved till I got within about 20 feet of it.  It woke up and lumbered into the ocean.  He looked to be in poor condition.  That made two old guys out there at once.

I seem to be falling into a routine.  I get up in the mornings with a pretty full to do list in my mind.  After breakfast I seem to have trouble deciding which task to start on first.  Unable to decide on a task I just go play.  Today I drove down the beach to the mouth of the Alsek river to look for glass floats.  The Alsek is a glacier fed river.  The water is a light gray from all the silt the glacier creates.  Today there were several pieces of ice that had floated all the way from the glacier to the mouth of the river.  One of them was half the size of the four wheeler.  My neighbor collects some of the ice from the river to keep her food cold in coolers.  I found a rare amber colored glass float.  A Google search says the amber color is rare and the glass probably started out as a beer bottle.

On the way back I saw something else unusual.  There was a beaver in the edge of the surf.  I thought beavers were strictly fresh water critters.  There wasn't a tree for this guy to chew on in sight.

A couple of days ago I mentioned doing some laundry.  My neighbor's adult kids spend part of the fishing season on a very remote river.  To do their laundry they clean out the totes they usually haul fish in.  Then they pour several gallons of fresh water into the tote.  Add a little detergent, add the clothes then just drive around on the four wheeler pulling the tote.  The agitation caused by bumping along the riverbank gets the clothes ""cleaner""!

The official commercial fishing season in this area is always the first Sunday in June.  The fish and game people monitor how many fish are moving through the rivers and regulate the allowed fishing days after that official opening day.  So everyone around here is getting ready to go fishing on Sunday.  With a little help I think I might give it a try.

The wild strawberries are beginning to bloom.  The ground is nearly covered with them.  I noticed tonight how far the snow line has moved up the mountains.  The glaciers are very aparent now that the snow is retreating.

The weather is still beautiful.  Mid sixties during the day.  Very little wind.  It has been in the upper forties each morning.  The wood stove knocks the chill off in about ten minutes.

The biggest outdoor project left to do is build a new outhouse.  The one here is OK but...it tilts a little.  The view from in there is wonderful.  I enjoy it every morning.  One can't help but enjoy the view because the door is off its hinges and is sitting alongside the building.  I'm not sure the new one even needs a door.

Fitz asked about mowing the grass and snakes.  There are no snakes in Alaska.  The neighborhood has a beast of a flail mower you pull behind an ATV.  In front of the cabin above the high water line there are sea oats that give way to the strawberries and some low growing grass with moss mixed in.  Then as the ground gradually rises the Alders take over and after them the spruce trees.  It is hard to believe that when this cabin was built in the eighties there were no trees around here.

I saw the bears the first time when I was putting my fishing boat in the water. It is a very heavy duty home made aluminum boat about 18 feet long. Up here there is an ingenious way of building the boats so a trailer is not required to move them across the land. Two automobile wheels on short stubby axles slide into pockets near the back of the boat. You back the boat into the water, slide the wheels out and you are on your way. To go across land again, just park the boat in shallow water, slide the wheels back in and go. Very simple...in my case the shallow water required was deeper than my boots were tall. No real problem since my wet feet were close to home.

After running the boat up and down the river a couple of times I came back to shore a little to fast. One second I am headed toward the shallow water on shore. Next second I'm looking at the sky. The boat has a very wide flat bottom for stability. When it runs aground one stops in a lot less than a New York minute. Well the boat stopped and I didn't till the space between the front and back seat benches caught me. Not a big problem except I was so far ashore I needed help getting the boat back in the ""shallow"" water to get the wheels back on.

My neighbor Pat came over to help me get my nets in order for the season opener for salmon on Sunday. It is very complicated. The regulations are reasonable considering the catch has to be managed so enough salmon get through to spawn and sustain the fishery. For a newbe like me trying to understand webbing, fathoms and mesh depth which can all vary depending on the water you are fishing and the targeted fish. I have thought enough about it today.

Later we took my boat over to the Alsek river (a huge fast river). On the way one of those wheels fell off. We got it back on without a lot of trouble. As I approached the cabin coming back the two bears were on my side of the river. Charlie, the neighbor's bear dog spotted them. Charlie weighs maybe 50 pounds. She went tearing out after these two grizzly bears. At first they just watch her barreling toward themselves. Then they seem to think, ""who is that little thing kidding""? But she is coming at them so fast and seems so determined the two bears turn tail and run right into and across the river. Charlie came back looking very proud of herself.

The webbing is different sizes depending on what you are trying to catch. The webbing is a little to big for sockeye salmon but a couple of them will have to do for Sunday's opening.

Last evening. I was sitting inside the bigger window and saw something brown move right under the window. It took up a lot of space on the ground. First thought was bear. It turned out to be a swarm of otters. I couldn't get a good count cause they were moving so quickly. I know there were five and maybe seven. As I watched they all went under the cabin. I proceeded to make much stomping noise on the floor. I didn't see them leave but they have because I didn't hear or see them at all later. If they had settled in under there I was going borrow Charlie to go under there after them.

This morning one of the world's great travelers stopped for a visit. An American Golden Plover was on the front yard. The breeding habitat of American Golden Plover is Arctic tundra from northern Canada and Alaska. They nest on the ground in a dry open area. They are migratory and winter in southern South America. They follow an elliptical migration path; northbound birds pass through Central America about January–April. In fall, they take a more easterly route, flying mostly over the western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea to the wintering grounds in Patagonia. The bird has one of the longest known migratory routes of over 25,000 miles. Of this, 2,400 miles is over open ocean where it cannot stop to feed or drink. It does this from body fat stores that it stocks up on prior to the flight. Most of this paragraph I pulled off the Internet.

These two rivers can be characterized as low volume fisheries, while the Alsek river in particular produces particularly high quality salmon due to its low temperature. The Alsek's silt content also prevents the sun from damaging the fish.""  I did a little more research on the Alsek.  This afternoon its flow volume was 45,800 cubic feet of water per second.  For comparison at the same time the flow of the Colorado river at Durango was 1,300 CFS.  The Alsek is a BIG river.  Where we were fishing was in some sheltered water right at the mouth.  I could hear the surf in the Pacific as I sat in the boar waiting for a fish to hit the net.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yesterday we dropped the nets in the water shortly after noon.  We stayed on the river till after eight last night.  This morning we left before 5:00 to resume fishing.  I was able to catch 4 sockeye yesterday and today brought in that fish I'm holding above as well as another King and a couple more sockeye.  My neighbors have a company that sells these fish directly to restaurants as far away as Newark, NJ.  That fish I caught this morning may well be in Newark Wednesday night.  I sell them the fish at the going rate right off my boat.  Then they clean them and pack them in Ice.  An air service will pick the packed fish up and take them to Yakutat.  There they are loaded onto one of the two jets that come through everyday, end up in Seattle where they are air freighted on to the restaurant.  Next Sunday we do it all again.  I expect in the next week of so there will be more days of fishing after each opening.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A cousin asked what happens to the parts of the fish that we don't keep?  Where my buyer cleans the fish is about a mile from the Pacific.  Today I took all the heads, guts etc. over to the beach and spread them out at the edge of the surf.  In less than 30 seconds after I pulled away ravens were there grabbing morsels.  In less than 90 seconds the first 4 Bald Eagles showed up.  After 5 minutes there must have been a dozen eagles swooping in to grab something.  Many of them would land but some of them would just glide in real low, grab something and fly off with it.  Another fisherman told me the eagles soon learn to associate the 4 wheeler on the beach at that spot with food.  When they learn that you can look up and down the coast and see eagles coming in from as far as you can see.</p>

One of the neighbors was fishing the other day.  He hooked a good size salmon right at the mouth of the East Alsek river.  The fish headed back out to sea.  As the fish swam through the incoming waves along the beach, the fisherman could look into the vertical  surface of the wave, just before it broke, and see the fish he was fighting at his eye level. He said it was beautiful with the light coming through the wave, the silhouette of the fish suspended in the light green  water.   So I had to go try that this afternoon.

The King Salmon I caught the other day was big but some of them can be almost twice that big.  When you hook one of those big fish you had better have plenty of line on your reel cause the fish may run out 50 or more yards of line before you can turn it back toward you. The rod I took out with me came with the cabin.   As I cast it the first few times I noticed it wouldn't let the lure go out very far.  There probably wasn't 50 feet of line on the reel.  I did catch a nice Dolly Varden trout but the wind came up again, the water had white caps so I came back in and put a new line on the reel.

I left the boat in the river on the other side of Dry Bay.  Pulling it over there last week I had some trouble with one of the wheels.  Tomorrow I plan to go over there and bring the bad wheel back here to see what I need to do to repair it.  Later this week the weather is supposed to be nice.  If I get some of these odd jobs done maybe I'll be able to do some serious beachcombing.  Life is so tough here.  So many fun things to do.  The sun rises tomorrow at 4:07 and sets at 10:25.  It never does get really dark.

That image came from Google Earth.  On my computer if I click on the picture it enlarges.  That is Dog Salmon creek coming down from the top of the picture and merging with the East Alsek river.  The neighbors I refer to so often live in the cabin just above mine.  That is an unused air strip behind their cabin.  Now the planes just land in front of the cabins.

Two kinds of geese were feeding in the front yard off and on during this day filled with showers.  Brant Geese and Greater White-fronted geese. The latter have beautiful coloration in their feathers.

The rain kept me inside most of the day again.  I got the cook stove tuned up and tried the oven for the first time.  I know one reader who will be pleased to read I baked a loaf of bread.  I brought 25 pounds of flour up here.  Now that I have tasted success using some of it maybe buying that much was a good idea.

The neighbor, whose cabin is just off the left side of the picture, has had a bear hanging around his place.  Tonight coming back from fishing (no luck) the bear was on the river bank in front of that same cabin.  I was maybe a hundred feet from the bear before I saw it.  One way to haze the bears and discourage them from hanging around too close is to make a lot of noise.  So not wanting to retreat and encourage the bear I down shifted and ran right at him.  He stood up to see what was causing all that noise, saw me coming at him, hollering and gunning the engine. I don't know what he thought but he went up the bank and disappeared into the brush.

The lumber in the picture, 20- 2x4s and 30 - 1x6 boards all sixteen feet long, sawn from logs salvaged along the river. Today we hauled six times that much lumber across Dry Bay to our cabin sites here on the East River.  Those boards are heavy duty.  When I say 1x6 that is the true dimension. A 1x6 you buy at a lumberyard is actually .75 inches by 5.5 inches.

It's about six miles across Dry Bay to where we unloaded the boats. The boats are used to ferry the lumber from the other side of the Alsek river. that is where the better logs are. We use the same trailers shown in an earlier post without the fish totes on them. There is a maze of roads across Dry Bay. I made three trips across and used three different routes. You could call those trips a learning experience. Several times I found myself someplace other than where I thought I should be. On one return trip I thought I would keep to higher, drier ground. Well what goes up must come down. The slight drop in elevation concentrated the water in one spot. When I got 1.7 miles (I had the GPS) from the cabin I got stuck. I started to walk out for help but decided maybe the 4 wheeler would pull itself out if I unhooked the trailers. That worked. So two of us went back, roped the two wheelers together and got the load out of the soft spot.

On the last trip over the bear that has been hanging around happened to be out in the open. I got to chase him for a few hundred yards. I wish the wheeler had a speedometer. I bet he was running 20 Mph while looking back to see if I was still after him. Consensus is that it is an adolescent bear and just hasn't figured out that the people who live in those big boxes we call cabins don't like bears in the yard. On the way back the bear was there again. Charlie and another bear dog spotted the bruin. Off they went one on each side of the bear. They harassed the beast till he went into the brush.

What about the bear coming back two times that night looking for more and eating part of the 4 wheeler seat. What about being positionally challenged on the Alsek river at 11:00 at night or the cross country walk that got me to the cabin after midnight, then getting up at 4:30 to go check the nets again. Maybe it should be about pulling 17 sockeye keepers out of my net in one pass. I could finish up by describing how I am determined to learn more about all the things my GPS can do for me.

This was the second day the set gillnet fishing season has been open for the Alsek River this year. I fish two nets. I try and position them to catch the sockeye salmon heading upstream to spawn. There are also king Salmon on the river now and we catch a few of them along with the sockeye.

The process of getting the fish from the river to your local fish market is not a long one but because the product is so fragile pretty complicated.

I sell the fish to Alsek Fish. They are a small speciality supplier to markets and fine resturants across the lower 48 states. I deliver the fish hole and am paid by the pound. Different fish bring different prices. Alsek Fish cleans the fish, packs them in ice and air freights the fish to its final destination. Simple right? Noooooo. To get the fish from the river to the air freight office requires a chartered bush plane to fly them there after landing on the beach. The fish are packed in ice. That requires an ice making machine that depends on a generator for power. The bush plane has a charter fee. The fish are packed in special waxed cardboard boxes. Specific labels are required on each box of fish shipped. Alaska fish and game requires certain paperwork indicating where the fish were caught and by whom.

183,3,2013-06-15 21:43:32,2013-06-16 05:43:32,"Another beautiful day. I spent the morning with one of the old timer Dry Bay fishermen. He showed me some places to set my nets on this side of the Alsek. Then we took his boat way up the river. In some places we could see very troubled water. Big swirls and whorl pools. The current was very fast. He had a depth finder on his boat. The water was 40 to 70 feet deep along there. A couple of weeks ago I reported here that the Colorado River was flowing at 1,300 cubic feet per second. The Colorado is a big river in that part of the country. A while back the Alsek was flowing at over 150,000 CFM according to my friend. It is a very big river.

On the boat tour this morning he told me about the wolf that would walk along the bank where ha fished nearly every day one season. Today he pointed out a couple of Bald Eagle nests in trees right at the edge of the river.

When I got home this friendly bird was here to greet me. It looks like a dove but it has a squared off tail and a black band around its neck. The pictures I have of mourning doves don't have the black band and their tails are pointed. I appreciated this beautiful birds presence.

Moving across the beaches you frequently cause the birds, eagles, ravens, gulls and other shore birds to take flight. The four wheeler doesn't have a speedometer so I don't know how fast I'm going but I figure at least thirty MPH. I think it surprises the birds when you pull up along side them as they think they are moving away from you. I call it ""Racing Ravens"".

A big day tomorrow. A neighbor from Colorado is coming to help me for a few days. The chore list is getting longer every day even though I'm pretty busy trying to mark things off it. The plane I chartered will bring in the new four wheeler some plywood and lots of fuel as well as my neighbor. It will land right in front of the cabin.

Late this afternoon I went King salmon fishing again. There were several in the river. One of them looked huge. A couple of them would follow my lure for a while then turn away.

185,3,2013-06-15 21:42:33,2013-06-16 05:42:33,"Another beautiful day.  I spent the morning with one of the old timer Dry Bay fishermen.  He showed me some places to set my nets on this side of the Alsek.  Then we took his boat way up the river.  In some places we could see very troubled water.  Big swirls and whorl pools. The current was very fast.  He had a depth finder on his boat.  The water was 40 to 70 feet deep along there.  A couple of weeks ago I reported here that the Colorado River was flowing at 1,300 cubic feet per second.  The Colorado is a big river in that part of the country.  A while back the Alsek was flowing at over 150,000 CFM according to my friend.  It is a very big river.

On the boat tour this morning he told me about the wolf that would walk along the bank where ha fished nearly every day one season.  Today he pointed out a couple of Bald Eagle nests in trees right at the edge of the river.

When I got home this friendly bird was here to greet me.  It looks like a dove but it has a squared off tail and a black band around its neck.  The pictures I have of mourning doves don't have the black band and their tails are pointed.  I appreciated this beautiful birds presence.

Moving across the beaches you frequently cause the birds, eagles, ravens, gulls and other shore birds to take flight.  The four wheeler doesn't have a speedometer so I don't know how fast I'm going but I figure at least thirty MPH.  I think it surprises the birds when you pull up along side them as they think they are moving away from you.  I call it ""Racing Ravens"".  

A big day tomorrow.  A neighbor from Colorado is coming to help me for a few days.  The chore list is getting longer every day even though I'm pretty busy trying to mark things off it.  The plane I chartered will bring in the new four wheeler some plywood and lots of fuel as well as my neighbor.  It will land right in front of the cabin.  

Late this afternoon I went King salmon fishing again.  There were several in the river.  One of them looked huge. A couple of them would follow my lure for a while then turn away.  I did hook one sockeye but it got off.  I'll just have to keep trying.",JUNE 15th,,inherit,open,open,,183-revision-v1,,,2013-06-15 21:42:33,2013-06-16 05:42:33,,183,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/06/15/183-revision/,0,revision,,0

We got a late start fishing yesterday.  This morning we left the cabin around 6 to check the nets.  It is a 20 minute four wheeler ride from the cabin to where I anchor the boat.  One net only had a couple of fish in it.  The other had a few more and one 20 pound King Salmon.  I made enough today to pay for the gas I used.

One of the fish in the net had been chewed on a little by a seal.  We brought it home and had it for dinner tonight.  It was delicious.

We tried some sport fishing later but all we caught were little sculpin.

Tomorrow will probably be spent working on the walls of the new cabin going up next door.  If this weather holds the owners will probably be sleeping in their new cabin by the weekend.

Information has come in on that bird I described a couple of days ago.  It is an Eurasian Collared Dove.  It is believed They were accidentally introduced to the US.

Some of the wildflowers are beginning to fade but others are just beginning to come out. The white lupines are not uncommon but compared to the blue ones they are a very small percentage of the total. In other words the blue lupines are everywhere. Acres and acres of them. The little shooting stars are past their prime but there are some places where their dark pink hue carpets the ground. Wild strawberries are blooming in every spot they can get a glimpse of the sky. The yellow Indian paintbrush have just come out and the side yard will be covered with daisies next week.

There were at least 4 happy people at Dry Bay today. The young couple whose cabin I have been helping to build got to stand on their new second floor this afternoon. For me it was a special moment to see them up there experiencing the view for the first time from what will be their bedroom. I know it was a special moment for them too. They stood there, arms around each other feeling one of their dreams come true.

Another happy person was my neighbor who is visiting. He caught his first Salmon with a rod and reel this evening. I don't know exactly what he was doing that I wasn't but he hooked twelve fish in his opinion, landed the one. I hooked the same log on the bottom of the river twice and that was it for me. I am supposed to guide some other fishermen later this summer. I guess if they catch all the fish they might think I'm a pretty good guide. If they expect me to show them how to catch the fish I may not last long as a guide

By clearing out around the cabin I found a kayak buried under some of the unwanted stuff. It looks like it will float but I'm going to wait for the water to warm up some more before I try it out.

Some of the wildflowers are beginning to fade but others are just beginning to come out. The white lupines are not uncommon but compared to the blue ones they are a very small percentage of the total. In other words the blue lupines are everywhere. Acres and acres of them. The little shooting stars are past their prime but there are some places where their dark pink hue carpets the ground. Wild strawberries are blooming in every spot they can get a glimpse of the sky. The yellow Indian paintbrush have just come out and the side yard will be covered with daisies next week.

There were at least 4 happy people at Dry Bay today. The young couple whose cabin I have been helping to build got to stand on their new second floor this afternoon. For me it was a special moment to see them up there experiencing the view for the first time from what will be their bedroom. I know it was a special moment for them too. They stood there, arms around each other feeling one of their dreams come true.

Another happy person was my neighbor who is visiting. He caught his first Salmon with a rod and reel this evening. I don't know exactly what he was doing that I wasn't but he hooked twelve fish in his opinion, landed the one. I hooked the same log on the bottom of the river twice and that was it for me. I am supposed to guide some other fishermen later this summer. I guess if they catch all the fish they might think I'm a pretty good guide. If they expect me to show them how to catch the fish I may not last long as a guide

The other pleased person here today was me. We got most of the remaining accumulated junk into a big pile and burnt it up. It is almost eleven as I type this and the stuff is still smoldering. By clearing out around the cabin I found a kayak buried under some of the unwanted stuff.

The Alsek river is running very high due to the extremely long spell of dry, sunny weather. The snow in the mountains is melting faster than normal. That water accelerates the glacier's melting so many icebergs are coming down the river. Add to all that the super moon caused the highest tide swing (15 feet from high tide to the next low tide) since I have been here.

All that water caused havoc with the fishing. The spots that usually hold fish don't. Trees floating down the river tear out the nets. A lot of limbs and twigs get caught in the nets causing the fish to avoid getting caught. I caught a dozen sockeye. Two of them were damaged in the net by seals. The buyer couldn't use them so I brought them home to eat.

The last three nights my neighbor Rick or I have cleaned a salmon down at the creek in front of the cabin. A bald eagle sits down there waiting for us to toss a scrap into the water or up on the bank of the stream. As soon as we do the eagles pumps its wings a couple of times and glides over and snatches the morsel. It must have a nest near buy. It flies off in the same direction every time. In about one minute it returns looking for more. If there is another scrap nearby the bird has already seen it and is gliding straight toward it...ignoring me. The eagle swooshes right over my head, not ten feet off the ground. Even with my poor hearing I can hear the air passing over its wings as it goes by. By now other eagles have seen the commotion and have begun to gather. Also by now the scraps provided buy one salmon are nearly gone. It is a sight to see, these magnificent wild birds so close.

Well it was another great day here in Dry Bay, Alaska.

The tides have been very high the last few days. The highest tides can wash out of the sand dunes these antique floats that have been buried for many decades. Rick has been diligent in looking for those glass fishing floats. After a higher than normal tide he will go out and beachcomb looking for a float to bring back to Colorado. Yesterday he was about thirty minutes behind a neighbor who was also looking. The neighbor found one. If Rick had been a little earlier he would have found it sitting out there on the sand.

Today Rick got up very early and was the first one down the beach. His quest for a glass ball to bring back to Colorado is now over.  In fact he found two. He is a happy beachcomber.

Last Sunday while we were fishing we stopped at an island where seagulls nest. There were many beautiful Glaucious-winged gulls nesting there. (Sorry my camera strap got into the picture.) The locals can collect the gull eggs to eat. I have had some and they are delicious. They are quite a bit larger than extra large chicken eggs.

Rick's day continued to be successful. He smoked his first batch of salmon. His recipe included sprinkling some brown sugar on the filets before s oping them over an Alder fire. They turned out great.

Late this evening he was going down to the creek on the four wheeler to clean the metal grills he had used to smoke the fish on. He stopped at the edge of the yard and walked back to the cabin. I asked him what was wrong. He just gestured for me to look over his shoulder.

Well it was shinny and new this morning.  Now it is an experienced saw.  It cut boards all day.  A lot of progress was made on the new cabin next door.  The saw and I tried to keep up to five others busy nailing down the boards that we had cut to length. 

Tomorrow if the weather is good we will get the roof rafters all up and maybe even start on the roofing.  

Early this morning and again late (10:30 p.m.) I went down the beach looking for glass floats.  Both trips were fruitless for finding floats but the ever changing sea shore continues to be a wonder to me.  The East Alsek river flows parallel to the ocean for a couple of miles before it makes a right angle turn into the sea. I haven't been here two months but in that time the little East Alsek river has eroded the ten foot tall bank where it turn to the sea by about eight feet.  An old green bucket had washed up on the top of the bank in some past storm.  That bucket has been my reference for noticing how much the bank has washed away.

Meanwhile the mighty Alsek river continues to make major changes to the area around its mouth.  I will post a picture soon.  There is a sand dune there that is probably 20 feet high from the water's edge.  Some days there is a beach thirty feet wide at the base of this sand dune.  Tonight there was no beach.  The current and tide had washed the beach away and a vertical wall of sand dropped directly into the river. 

Mentioned several times recently were the high tides and above average river flow because of the warm weather melting the mountain snow.  Tonight the beach was littered with many trees and grasses pulled off the banks of the river farther up stream.  A lot of glacier ice was also on the beach.  I brought some home to put in the cooler.  Got to keep those three apples in there cool.

Rick has one of those new little GoPro cameras that takes great movies.  Tonight he took some fish scraps down to the edge of the creek to see if he could capture an eagle swooping down to grab a bite.  It wasn't  long before he had his video.  If a morsel of fish had feelings it wouldn't know what hit it.  Those birds come in so fast and are so accurate in grabbing something off the surface it is amazing.

We wrapped up the kitchen reconstruction this morning. This afternoon we helped on the new cabin some more. Rick helped sheath the exterior walls and I framed in two large windows in what will be their living room. As I was making the cuts for the window opening Katilyn called her dog over and showed the dog that she would be able to see out.

This is Katilyn, Brant and their dog Kirya. This is the couple I wrote about a few days ago and how much pleasure it brings me to see their joy in having their own place take shape. These young people have pulled logs out of the woods and off the beach to a sawmill. They ran the mill to cut every stick of lumber in that cabin. Kirya has already found a spot to rest on the living room floor to keep watch on everything.

We are always welcome at the neighbors for meals but after working hard on the cabin an invitation to have pizza couldn't be passed up. Tonight Lisa fed 15 people pizza. At one point she had four cooking in her oven at one time. One of the fishermen has his 91 year old mother up here for a few weeks. She likes to do those word puzzles where a matrix of random letters have hidden words. She does the big ones where there may be 40 words to find. I helped her fond one word while she had found several on her own. Her name is Gwen and she is a wizard at the ""find the words"" puzzles.

If you ever watch those nature shows where a feeding frenzy takes place with dolphins, or a pride of lions or vultures on a kill. It is sort of like that on Pizza night at Lisa's When Rick and I arrived there were already eight people there and ten (10) four wheelers in various states of repair in the yard. As the feeding got underway, people kept dropping in. Lisa is such a good neighbor when she realized one neighbor had not gotten the word about pizza night she took some over to him.

Pizza night at Lisa's means country music on the satellite radio.

Today we decided to cross the East River in the four wheelers and beachcomb that isolated 12 mile stretch of beach down to an obstruction called "" the rocks"" because they prevent you from taking the wheelers any farther. I asked the retired Vet I'd he would like to join us so the three of us on four wheelers started off. We had no trouble crossing the river. Last time we drowned my older Honda wheeler. This time no problem.

About half way to the rocks you have to cross seal creek. The gulls and eagles were feeding on something right at the mouth of the creek.

There were so many of these little fish concentrated in one place in the surf it was a dark color.

Just beyond the rocks there is a roaring stream that is the outlet of a glacier fed lake. The color of the water is gray from the glacial silt. It is only about a mile from where we were to the lake so we went to see it. The easiest route to the lake is to walk on the bear trail that parallels the stream and beach.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image18.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-232"" alt=""image"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image18-1024x768.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /></a>

The beauty of the rain forest cannot be shown in a photograph but thanks to Rick, who's camera had not yet run out of battery, you can get a peek at it. The glacier lake was FULL of icebergs. This glacier is retreating and you could see where in the past it had scoured the mountain sides along its edges down to bedrock

We didn't find any collectible treasures on the way down the beach but on the way back things became more interesting. At seal creek where all the little fish were spawning earlier there was a bear. When I came up on this guy he was walking along the edge of the surf. When he got to the place where the fish had been he just laid down in the water. Sometimes the waves washing over him would actually pick the bear up mad move him a little ways. Rick and I watched the bear lounge in the surf for a while. When the bear got up and started walking toward us I decided to take the initiative and started toward him on the wheeler. These bears don't have very good eyesight and the sound of the surf kept it from hearing us. So the only thing to do was get his attention.

I don't like harassing the bears but better me harassing them than them harnessing me. I chased it across seal creek until it disappeared into the sea oats on the other side of the creek.

On the way home I baptized the new Honda four wheeler. There is a step bank along the side of the East River. I had been past there three times already today but on my fourth pass I lost inertia and went head first into the river. My first thought was how warm the water was. Second thought was turn off the engine before it sucked water into it. My second thought was too slow.

Rick, using the older Honda we baptized a couple of weeks ago, towed me back across the East River to the cabin. Before we could use the older machine to pull me we had to float the newly drowned Honda seventy five yards upstream in the river to a spot where the bank was not so steep and he could get me out. I reworked the new machine just like we did tho older one, changed the oil, checked the differentials for water, dried the air cleaner filter, etc. Now the new Honda can rest assured when it comes to the end of its life it will be saved and go to Honda four wheeler heaven.",JUNE 29th,,publish,open,open,,june-29th,,,2013-06-29 22:05:21,2013-06-30 06:05:21,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=234,0,post,,2

Yesterday Rick and I made arrangements to go fishing with the retired veterinarian who has a cabin just down stream from mine. This gentleman (gentle man) has so many interests not the least of which is catching those hard to catch sockeye salmon.

So at eight o'clock sharp this morning Rick, the Vet, his dog Bennie and I went fishing. Rick had already caught a few sockeye with his rod. I had not caught one yet. The Vet wrote the book on how to do it. Bennie's job was to keep an eye out for bears.

That is the view I had all day fishing. Mount Fairweather dominates. Canada is on the left side of that mountain. If you zoom in there are three bears right at the edge of the water near the center of the picture. That sow and her two cubs have not been causing any problems. When we first arrived to fish this morning the two cubs were chasing each other up and down the edge of the water. So pristine.

Some of the fish were pretty far along in their preparation to spawn. The fish right out of the ocean are very silvery. As they change into spawning mode the sockeye's bodies turn read and their heads green. We didn't keep those fish that were not still silvery.

As I mentioned we left at eight. We got home a little after five. Everybody caught fish. It was a good day.

Bennie did his job and alerted us when a forth bear showed up across the river from where we were fishing. The East Alsek River is a clear water stream. We could see literally dozens of big salmon in the water a rods length away. The Vet and I are the old timers on this side of Dry Bay. He and Bennie are practically inseparable. After standing in the river for a couple of hours waiting on his master, this is what Bennie likes to do.

Tat is my official SNOOPY tackle box in the foreground.  I like to look like I know what I'm doing out there.  I think the orange color really sets me off as a fishing guide.

Now the ice box is full of fish. Rick leaves on Wednesday. Between now and then he wants to smoke a bunch of these fish.",JUNE 30th,,inherit,open,open,,240-revision-2,,,2013-06-30 20:43:44,2013-07-01 04:43:44,,240,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/06/30/240-revision-2/,0,revision,,0
244,3,2013-07-01 21:56:25,2013-07-02 05:56:25,"Today's post starts last night.  We had had a great day fishing and were winding down after cleaning the fish and putting them cooler.  

My cooler is really a freezer.  It works great but there are more things I just want to keep cool than there are things I want to freeze.  It is an old beast and uses a lot of electricity.  So I ride down to the handy beach and pick up some glacier ice that has washed in, bring it home put it in a pan in the unplugged freezer.  It makes a great cooler.

Anyhow, about ten last night Rick spots a bear sniffing around down by the creek where we had cleaned the fish.  It didn't stay too long and soon moved on up the river.  Not ten minuteslater a cow moose and her twin calves came out of the brush.  You could tell the cow knew there had been a bear around from her posture, scenting the air, looking in the direction the bear had gone. Her calves were very young.  They stayed very close to mom as she walked out into the river and stopped on a sand bar.  These sand bars appear as the tide goes out and the water drops.  As she stood there the calves nursed, one on each side.  I went to bed about ten thirty.

I got up this morning a little after six and the moose were still out there on the sand bar.  The mother moose was down and the calves were standing beside her.  I thought this is going to be interesting if the cow was stuck in the sand in the middle of the river.  The tide was coming in.  There is a hungry grizley who's favorite treat this time of year is moose calf.  The calves would nudge the cow but she just stayed down in the incoming water looking around.  This was all around 6:15 this morning.  I put the coffee on thinking what I should do...let nature take its course?  I'm part of nature.  I thought about riding down there on the Honda and that might alarm the cow enough that she could free herself.

At 6:30 I looked out and they were gone.  In talking to the locals these cows frequently drop their calves in the large open spaces that occure here at Dry Bay.  They have learned that they can see predators much better in these open areas than they could in the brush.  That cow with her new born twins took them to spend the night where she thought they would be safe.  On a sand bar in the middle of a river.  That's my slant on it anyway.

I had borrowed a piece of string from the my neighbor the Vet to use as a fish stringer yesterday.  I go by his cabin on the way to look for glass floats on the beach.  I found another glass float, delivered the piece of string and bartered five gallons of gas for use of the Vet's vacum packing food saver machine and some plastic bags.  Now I have some vacum packed sockeye in his freezer (his is new and doesn't use much electricity). 

Rick stayed close to the fish smoker all day.  The setup I have needs a little modifying so when you are smoking the fish you don't have to tend to the fire/smoke as frequently (every 30 minutes or so).  However, maybe I should leave well enough alone.  His smoked Salmon are delicious.

This evening I went down to the mouth of the Alsek.  I don't know what was going on differently but the direction of the waves on the incoming tide were eroding this tall sand bank very rapidly.  This huge dune is at least a mile long and where it drops off into the Alsek it is about 20 feet high.  There are many logs buried in the side of the dune, washed in there decades ago during storms.

Tonight the river current flowing out and incoming tide pushing in were having a battle at the base of this sand dune.  I watched logs 15 feet long and 12 inches in diameter wash out of that wall of sand.  Several times I watched large wedges of sand slide into the river.  These slides of sand were much bigger than dump truck loads of sand.  As one of them slipped into the water it took a full foot of the top of the dune with it.  Tonight the mouth of the Alsek is about three miles away.  If this pace of erosion keeps up next year the mouth will be 2 and a half miles from the cabin.

I watched logs 15 feet long and 12 inches in diameter wash out of that wall of sand.  Several times I watched large wedges of sand slide into the river.  These slides of sand were much bigger than dump truck loads of sand.  As one of them slipped into the water it took a full foot of the top of the dune with it.  Tonight the mouth of the Alsek is about three miles away.  If this pace of erosion keeps up next year the mouth will be 2 and a half miles from the cabin.

That is not likely though.  There is probably some park service regulation that will prevent it.",JULY 3rd,,inherit,open,open,,257-revision-2,,,2013-07-03 22:28:17,2013-07-04 06:28:17,,257,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/07/03/257-revision-2/,0,revision,,0

There are some very good cooks here.  Everything from raw oysters to chili.  Cookies to hot cinnamon rolls.  Several pasta salads, lamb cooked perfectly, as mentioned lots of GOOD food.

274,3,2013-07-06 21:09:39,2013-07-07 05:09:39,"A pretty calm day here today. I went across to check on my boat and bail out the rain water from the last couple of days. Every time I check on it I start the engine and let it run a short while. I won't be doing that much longer. When that old outboard is cold it is so slow to start. It does not have an electric starter. It is a fair workout pulling on the starter cord of a 75 horsepower engine about 35 times before she fires. When I got back to my neighbor's satellite phone I ordered a new outboard.....with an electric starter.

Ever since I got here on May third I have been looking out the kitchen window at an old fiberglass boat. It has been sitting, bottom side up, in the same spot so long there is moss growing on the hull. I thought if I moved it to the other side of the cabin and raised it off the ground a few feet it would be a good place to park the Hondas out of the weather. So this afternoon I tied a rope to the far side, passed the rope over the boat and hooked it to the four wheeler. Now the boat is right side up and ready to be moved. No problem sliding it across the grass. The real work is about to begin though. I have to turn it back over so it is upside down then lift it a few feet off the ground. That old fiberglass eighteen foot boat is very heavy. More on this later......when I figure out what to do next.

It is a hummingbird I had never seen before. He drops by every few minutes. He is an Anna's hummingbird. The top of his head is red as well as his throat. I'm going to pull in some interesting information from the Internet about this beautiful bird.

Anna's Hummingbird (Calypte anna) is a medium-sized hummingbird native to the west coast of North America. This bird was named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-272"" alt=""image"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image3.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>

Anna's Hummingbird is 3.9 to 4.3 inches (10 to 11 centimeters) long. It has a bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. Its bill is long, straight and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red crown and throat, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Anna's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown.
These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small insects caught in flight. A PBS documentary that first aired January 10, 2010, shows how Anna's Hummingbirds eat flying insects. They aim for the flying insect, then open their beaks very wide. That technique has a greater success rate than trying to aim the end of a long beak at the insect.

Unlike most hummingbirds, the male Anna's Hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing a remarkable display, called a display dive, on their territories. The males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species. When a female flies onto a male's territory, he rises up approximately 30 metres (98 ft) before diving over the recipient. As he approaches the bottom of the dive the males reach an average speed which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive the male travels 23 metres per second (51 mph), and produces a loud sound described by some as an ""explosive squeak"" with his outer tail-feathers.

Anna's Hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America, from southern Canada to northern Baja California, and inland to southern Arizona. They tend to be permanent residents within their range, and are very territorial. However, birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana and Newfoundland.

Anna's hummingbirds are the only hummingbirds to spend the winter in northern climates; they are able to do this as there are enough winter flowers and food to support them. During cold temperatures, Anna's Hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat. In addition, hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of sub-freezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor.

276,3,2013-07-06 21:08:42,2013-07-07 05:08:42,"A pretty calm day here today. I went across to check on my boat and bail out the rain water from the last couple of days. Every time I check on it I start the engine and let it run a short while. I won't be doing that much longer. When that old outboard is cold it is so slow to start. It does not have an electric starter. It is a fair workout pulling on the starter cord of a 75 horsepower engine about 35 times before she fires. When I got back to my neighbor's satellite phone I ordered a new outboard.....with an electric starter.

Ever since I got here on May third I have been looking out the kitchen window at an old fiberglass boat. It has been sitting, bottom side up, in the same spot so long there is moss growing on the hull. I thought if I moved it to the other side of the cabin and raised it off the ground a few feet it would be a good place to park the Hondas out of the weather. So this afternoon I tied a rope to the far side, passed the rope over the boat and hooked it to the four wheeler. Now the boat is right side up and ready to be moved. No problem sliding it across the grass. The real work is about to begin though. I have to turn it back over so it is upside down then lift it a few feet off the ground. That old fiberglass eighteen foot boat is very heavy. More on this later......when I figure out what to do next.

The humming birds are back. The new batch must have all fledged and they have discovered the free food at Guthrie's cabin.

A real treat showed up a couple of weeks ago. It is a hummingbird I had never seen before. He drops by every few minutes. He is an Anna's hummingbird. The top of his head is red as well as his throat. I'm going to pull in some interesting information from the Internet about this beautiful bird.

Anna's Hummingbird (Calypte anna) is a medium-sized hummingbird native to the west coast of North America. This bird was named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-272"" alt=""image"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image3.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>

Anna's Hummingbird is 3.9 to 4.3 inches (10 to 11 centimeters) long. It has a bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. Its bill is long, straight and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red crown and throat, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Anna's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown.
These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small insects caught in flight. A PBS documentary that first aired January 10, 2010, shows how Anna's Hummingbirds eat flying insects. They aim for the flying insect, then open their beaks very wide. That technique has a greater success rate than trying to aim the end of a long beak at the insect.

Unlike most hummingbirds, the male Anna's Hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing a remarkable display, called a display dive, on their territories. The males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species. When a female flies onto a male's territory, he rises up approximately 30 metres (98 ft) before diving over the recipient. As he approaches the bottom of the dive the males reach an average speed which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive the male travels 23 metres per second (51 mph), and produces a loud sound described by some as an ""explosive squeak"" with his outer tail-feathers.

Anna's Hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America, from southern Canada to northern Baja California, and inland to southern Arizona. They tend to be permanent residents within their range, and are very territorial. However, birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana and Newfoundland.

Anna's hummingbirds are the only hummingbirds to spend the winter in northern climates; they are able to do this as there are enough winter flowers and food to support them. During cold temperatures, Anna's Hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat. In addition, hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of sub-freezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor.

I was one tired old guy. Two of us were on the roof nailing down the sheathing while we kept a whole crew of people on the ground sending up more material. Well, it wasn't a very big crew on the ground but I know some of them will read this and may want to debate who was keeping who busy.

This morning I went down to the mouth of the Alsek River to get some ice for the cooler. When I got back I took the fly rod out to play. It caught a nice sockeye salmon. This afternoon the neighbors saw the wolf mentioned a couple of days back. This time there were two others with it. I wish I could have seen the trio, one black, one gray, and a white one.

As you can see some very large chunks come down from the glacier. The pieces in the photo would have been many times larger before they floated down.

I frequently mention the mouth of that big river and all that goes on there with the battle between the river's current and the tides. The wall of sand, in the picture below, is constantly changing. Over the decades all sorts of stuff has been buried in those sand dunes. As the battle between the river and ocean keep occurring, twice a day, that buried material washes out. I have watched logs 20 feet long appear out of the dune then in a few days be gone as the sand that had them buried is washed away and the log is once again floating somewhere else.

That new roof on the cabin next door is the reason I didn't post anything here yesterday.  I was one tired old guy.  Two of us were on the roof nailing down the sheathing while we kept a whole crew of people on the ground sending up more material.  Well, it wasn't a very big crew on the ground but I know some of them will read this and may want to debate who was keeping who busy.

This morning I went down to the mouth of the Alsek River to get some ice for the cooler.

Berries and Bears could be the theme here today. Some of the neighbors have been picking lots of wild strawberries. Several batches of jam have been made already.

Tonight I was sitting on the step out front watching the bear and this little guy stopped for a visit.

I did get all the laundry done and it is much easier not having to pump the water.  Just go down to the creek with a tote, PARK ON A GRAVEL BAR, fill the tote with water, then add as needed to the washing machine.

The guy that pulled me out of the creek was the neighbor, the retired vet.  This man is a master fisherman on the East Alsek River.  Today the fish were there in good numbers.  I even managed to catch a few sockeye myself.  I also caught the first Pink Salmon of the season today.

The Alsek river is frequented by adventure rafters.  I understand they start out in Canada on what can be a two week long float down the river to Dry Bay, Alaska.  Here the rafters catch a bush plane back to civilization.  Often there is extra food at the end of their rafting trip.  We residents of Dry Bay get to share what they left behind.  This week I scored some bread, already cooked turkey sausage, and cereal.  Other neighbors got the fixings for pizza which will be shared with the community.  If those rafters knew how much fun will be had surrounding the stuff they left behind, I bet they would have stayed a few days longer.

That is a Dogfish Shark. I have done a little research:

Although it’s not a very popular seafood species in the United States, spiny dogfish have been harvested off the West Coast for nearly 1,000 years, starting with the tribal fisheries in Puget Sound. There was a short-lived but intense fishery for spiny dogfish livers in the 1930s and 1940s. Because researchers had discovered that the livers of spiny dogfish contained high levels of vitamin A, there was a strong demand for use of the liver oils in pharmaceuticals, food processing, and animal feed. Harvests began to decline in 1945 as spiny dogfish abundance declined, and in 1950, the introduction of synthetic vitamins destroyed the market for spiny dogfish livers. Harvests were minimal after the liver fishery ended, and with low catch levels, spiny dogfish abundance increased again by the late 1950s.

Today, there’s not much consumer demand for spiny dogfish. Off the West Coast and in Alaska, spiny dogfish are mostly caught as bycatch in fisheries for more commercially important species, and many fishermen throw them back because of their low value. Even though harvests are minimal, managers still limit the amount of spiny dogfish that can be harvested as a precaution against overfishing.

These small sharks live for several decades.  It takes six to eight years to reach sexual maturity.  They reproduce very slowly, a litter of shark pups might only be 4.

What I couldn't find on the internet was why they beach themselves.

This morning in about a quarter mile I counted 112 of these fish along the beach. Beyond that quarter mile there were no more to be found.

On a different note, this morning there were two adolescent bears across the river. I figure they are siblings. It was obvious they were in a good mood. They would chase each bother back and forth on the river bank. One of them went into the water to cool down. It just sat down for a few minutes then would stand up in the water and swat at it, shake its head then sit down again. In the mean time the one not in the water would rush toward the water, stop, stand up on his hind legs, spin around, drop back down on all fours and run in a circle. This went on for several minutes. Then the one in the water came out and they ran back up the river bank in the direction they had come.

This morning in about a quarter mile I counted 112 of these fish along the beach. Beyond that quarter mile there were no more to be found.

On a different note, this morning there were two adolescent bears across the river. I figure they are siblings. It was obvious they were in a good mood. They would chase each bother back and forth on the river bank. One of them went into the water to cool down. It just sat down for a few minutes then would stand up in the water and swat at it, shake its head then sit down again. In the mean time the one not in the water would rush toward the water, stop, stand up on his hind legs, spin around, drop back down on all fours and run in a circle. This went on for several minutes. Then the one in the water came out and they ran back up the river bank in the direction they had come. Ah to be young again!",JULY 14th,,inherit,open,open,,316-revision,,,2013-07-14 21:43:28,2013-07-15 05:43:28,,316,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/07/14/316-revision/,0,revision,,0

He was catching mice or voles in the tall grass. it would stand very still then jump into the air and I suppose come down on what ever was being hunted. As I watched with binoculars, I noticed a large bear feeding just a little farther back off the river. That scene was pure wilderness.

This morning I saw five bears before breakfast. Two sows with three cubs.

Later, motoring down the beach for some ice for the cooler I came across a family group of Brant Geese.

I looked toward the surf a few seconds later and those geese were flying along beside me. When I sped up they kept up. If I slowed down they did too, even to the point where they would drop their feet preparing to land. I sped up again, they picked up their feet and kept up. Finally I just stopped about 50 feet from the surf's edge. The geese landed between me and the ocean. It was amazing. The following is from the internet:

""It used to be a strictly coastal bird in winter, seldom leaving tidal estuaries, where it feeds on eel-grass and the seaweed. In recent decades, it has started using agricultural land a short distance inland, feeding extensively on grass and winter-sown cereals. This may be behaviour learnt by following other species of geese. Food resource pressure may also be important in forcing this change, as the world population has risen over tenfold to 400,000-500,000, possibly reaching the carrying capacity of the estuaries. In the breeding season, it uses low-lying wet coastal tundra for both breeding and feeding. The nest is bowl-shaped, lined with grass and down, in an elevated location, often in a small pond.""

Tomorrow my son and the new outboard arrive. I have to call the bush pilot in the morning. I am getting confusing and conflicting directions on where to meet the plane.

Several hours the last two days have been devoted to catching Salmon. The river is beginning to be full of Sockeye. We went down to the mouth twice today. Frequently we would see pods of Salmon coming in from the ocean. That is an awe inspiring sight. These fish coming in were spawned in this river 4 or 5 years ago. They have been swimming in the ocean most of that time but some internal clock and compass has brought then back to this river. They swim in out of the ocean with such determination.

My goal today was to get the new well in so I can plumb the cabin for running water.  The well is really just a pipe driven into the ground,  the bottom section of the pipe is called a sand point.  It is about four feet long and has many holes in it for the water to seep in.  On top of that there are three, three foot sections of pipe.  So all together there is a thirteen foot piece of pipe that needs to be driven into the ground.  The neighbors let us borrow a tool they made to do the job.  It is a pipe about four feet long. It is larger in diameter than the well pipe and had handles welded onto the sides. The closed end of this tool has about sixty pounds of steel welded into it. All together this pipe driver weighs about eighty pounds when you start using it. By the time you lift this thing, slide it down over the well pipe, and then slam it down on the well pipe about three hundred times it weighs at least 150 pounds. Thank heaven I had help.

Next we went over to the harbor to bring the boat to the cabin. The East River may open to commercial fishing this week so I wanted the boat over here by the cabin. When the dealer prepped the motor to be shipped on a plane he had to drain all the combustible fluids out of the engine. When we installed the new motor on the boat and tested it I wasn't real happy with the low speed idle. N there was a little hose with a loose end inside the engine cover. Gas would come out of this hose when the engine was running. Another fisherman has the same outboard so we compared them. His engine had the little hose with the loose end in it also but it didn't leak gas....mystery!

On the way back across Dry Bay the road is sometimes bumpy. At one especially bumpy spot I stopped to check to see if things were all right ini the boat. John ini the meantime is yelling ""FIRE!!!!FIRE!!!"". Smoke is coming out the bottom of the new outboard. Remember the gas leak?

Turns out the bump had capsized the battery. It shorted out on the aluminum boat and caused a little ground wire on the engine to overheat and melt the insulation. A little flame and a little more smoke but no big problem for the brand new , (did I mention expensive?) outboard. The gas leaking out of the tube was because the dealer drained the gas from the engine but did not retighten the valve so whenever the engine was on it was squirting gas out the open valve.

After dinner (John ate some of the camper food my daughter sent and I ate Grape Nuts) went fly fishing again. John had caught and released four before I got my first one hooked. While he was concentrating on one of his fish a bear had come out of the brush and approached the water's edge where he was fishing. John said he was close enough that he could see the bear's eyes. I bet the bear could see John's eyes too. They were twice as big as normal. Anyway all that sudden appearance of huge white eyes scared the bear away.

Walking back to the wheelers a bit more luck came his way. The glasses he had lost in the water yesterday were there in the sand waiting for him. It is amazing after two tide cycles that had not been swept away or buried in the sand.

One of the old timers I have referred to several times invited John to watch him do some commercial fishing with the gill nets. I used the word ""watch"" because to do any commercial fishing you must have a crew member license. For a quick introduction into set net fishing he didn't think a license was justified.

While he was ""watching"" I did some chores around the cabin.

He did finally land it and then released it to go on upstream to spawn and pass on those spirited genes.

The East River just outside the door will be open for commercial fishing on Tuesday. Dry Bay will be a busy place tomorrow as all the fishermen get their gear over here from the Alsek river. The Vet and I are going to fish together. He will be getting his net together while I get the boat in the water. I need to check the engine out after yesterday's near disaster.

The preparation part; All the fishermen who were over on the Alsek river are coming over here to take advantage of two more days fishing, on an easy river, with lots of fish in it.

There was a meeting today with the owner of the fish processing facility in Yakutat and the fishermen. The fishermen would like for the fish to be picked up at a landing strip right by the river. The processor has all his equipment in a facility several miles away and he wants the fishermen to haul all the fish to his place. There may be a little change in the processor's position but I think most of the fish will be hauled across dry bay to the processing facility.

This time of year it is not unusual for a small plane to land at one of the remote airstrips. When it stops out will pop some people with cameras, they walk around for a few minutes taking pictures then take off again. These sightseeing air excursions keep a lot of the bush pilots busy in the summer. This pilot got a little too far off the runway and his wheels sunk into the soft soil. Three of us attending the above meeting were able to push him around so he could take off again.

Another bit of preparation today was getting son John across the Alsek river to meet the plane that would take him to Yakutat so he could catch his flights back  home to Kentucky. I know he will be glad to get home and see his precious daughters. I also know he will miss walking out the front door to watch the grizzly bears or running to the river to catch another batch of sockeyes.  That's him in the green shirt with some neighbors and Charlie the bear dog.

This time of year it is not unusual for a small plane to land at one of the remote airstrips. When it stops out will pop some people with cameras, they walk around for a few minutes taking pictures then take off again. These sightseeing air excursions keep a lot of the bush pilots busy in the summer. This pilot got a little too far off the runway and his wheels sunk into the soft soil. Three of us attending the above meeting were able to push him around so he could take off again.

Another bit of preparation today was getting son John across the Alsek river to meet the plane that would take him to Yakutat so he could catch his flights back  home to Kentucky. I know he will be glad to get home and see his precious daughters. I also know he will miss walking out the front door to watch the grizzly bears or running to the river to catch another batch of sockeyes.  That's him in the green shirt with some neighbors and Charlie the bear dog.

I took that picture from the boat. That is my cabin in the background. A pretty short commute to work.  And a pretty commute too.

Another old timer (the retired veterinarian) and I teamed up to fish one net. Before we got the 20 fathom net all pulled out into the river we had a fish in it. We did OK for newbees. As you can see in the picture below there is a lot of moss in the clear water of the river.

One lesson we learned today is when the tide turns and starts pushing water back upstream, that moss that had been carried down stream comes back all at once. We had trouble pulling the net out of the water because it was so full of that heavy green moss. Another lesson was watch where you park the Hondas. The one in the top picture was in water half way up the wheels by the time we got the net out of the water. Some of these bigger tides come in real fast.

These are the sockeye that were in the net when we pulled it for the last time as the tide came in. The fish today averaged a little over six and a half pounds each.  We also caught several pink salmon. There is not much of a market for pinks so we released all of them.

370,3,2013-07-24 19:03:16,2013-07-25 03:03:16,"Today was the second day of fishing on the East Alsek river.  The fishermen who have fished the river for years continue to do well.  A couple hundred fish yesterday and a couple hundred again today.  They are good at it.  They work very hard.  Some of them were still fishing at 1:30 this morning.

The vet and I are best at providing entertainment for the others.  I have a brand new Yamaha ""high thrust"" 50 horsepower outboard.  Electric start, power trim and tilt, a first class top of the line outboard. Today the water was so shallow I had to get out of the boat and pull it up river by the anchor rope to where we wanted to set the net.

The tides seem to determine when the fish move in this part of the river.  We sat watching the net for two and a half hours this morning. And caught six fish.  When the tide turned and we caught four times that many in five minutes.  That incoming tide also floods where we park the wheelers and totes to haul the fish.  So we can't stay and continue fishing.

So this afternoon we picked another place near the mouth of the river to fish.  The water is deeper there and I can actually use my new outboard the way it was ment to be used.

The tide turns at about 10 p.m. this evening so I am writing this earlier than usual.  I want to be at the new location on the net to see how the change in the river current affects the fishing down there.

The experienced fishermen are disappointed we are moving out of their sight.  I think they had planned on making a video to document what it is like the first year one decides to fish commercially.  They are very supportive and encouraging.  I remind them of all the lessons they had to learn, the hard way, just as I am now.  I am loving it.

The new fishing spot was a morale boost from the very beginning. The water is deep enough there to use the outboard with no problems. The river bank has enough slope that it is easy to step out of the boat and watch the net from the shore. We can drive the Hondas right up to where the net is set if we need to load or unload anything from the boat.

The Vet and I decided to fish the new spot I mentioned yesterday, last evening. I wanted to see what would happen to the net when the tide turned and the fish started coming in. I didn't have to wait that long. We started catching fish right away. As it got later we kept wondering why the current in the river hadn't changed as the tide came in. It turned out we had misread the tide table. So we continued catching a few fish. Then the tide did turn. The expected influx of fish did happen and we finally had our hands full, picking fish out of the net in the wee hours of today.

On the way over to deliver the fish to the buyer we had trouble with both trailers. One flat tire and one set of bad bearings. No real problem though. Two broken trailers can be made into one whole trailer that can carry the other broken trailer home.

In the two days of fishing we caught a little over two hundred fish. They averaged around six pounds each. That is a lot of sockeye. The experienced guys on the river caught their fair share more than we did. It was a pretty good opening. On Sunday the river will be open for fishing again. We will be out there too but probably not as late as this morning.

I did a little beach combing after checking the boat this evening. After a two week drought I found a couple of prizes tonight.

I got the new well plumbed to the washing machine this morning.  No more running to the creek for wash water.  I had hoped to get the hot water heater hooked up but ended up destroying it instead.  The old pipes had fused themselves to the heater and could not be removed.  So when I get back to civilization I'll buy a small one to install.  All the plumbing will be ready so it shouldn't take long to have hot and cold running water....and a shower!

I went across Dry Bay today to borrow some tools from one of the other fishermen.  On the way home I came across a couple riding bicycles.  They were riding from Yakutat to Juneau cross country.  A couple of hundred miles!  Their bikes had tires almost 4 inches wide.  Only one speed.  No special gears.  The front and rear wheels are interchangeable.  No fancy suspension.  Just a frame with huge tires.

I invited Cameron and Iris to stop for a cup of coffee.  They jumped at the chance to have something hot to drink since the rain had kept them from having a fire for two days.

They cross the many rivers with small inflatable boats.  It took them about ten minutes to break their bikes down, inflate the boats, strap everything down and paddle across the East Alsek river.  They thought the trip would take 12 to 14 days.  Cameron said it couldn't take longer than that because that is how long their food would last.

Tonight a neighbor and his daughter invited me over to their cabin for home made ice cream.  To my grateful surprise they had some leftover pizza too.  If you have never tried sauerkraut pizza it is VERY VERY good.  This pizza consisted of crust, mustard, cheese, sauerkraut and polish sausage on it.  Tonight was the second time I have had this kind of pizza and I highly recommend you try it sometime.  The ice cream was pretty good too.

The young woman who created this culinary treat is a Nurse Practicioner working in Montrose, Colorado.  She has been coming up here to help her Dad fish since she was a little girl almost twenty years ago.  

Sunday at noon the river is open to fishing again until Wednesday at noon.  Some of the fishermen from up at Yakutat may come down here to fish since the river is open to fishing for three days.  If that happens things might get a little crowded around the better fishing spots.

This diagram shows what the end of the gill net that is out in the river looks like. The other end is similar except it is usually anchored on shore. The nets we are fishing right now are 120 feet long. The illustration shows the net hanging vertically. The East River is so shallow most places the bottom of the net is lying on the bottom. The following is off the internet:

Set gillnets consist of a single netting wall kept vertical by a float line and a weighted lead line. Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the float line. The lower line is made of lead cored rope. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters.

We did catch a few fish today. This morning fishing by myself I got to untangle two separate logs that the net drifted across. Big ole logs...a bad situation. Also the float line broke.... another bad situation.

These little books are about 4 inches wide and 6 inches tall. One page for each month contains all the information about the time of the two tide cycles each day and the height of the high and low tides.

This morning's high tide was at 8:07 so we started fishing at 5:00. The fish tend to ride the incoming tide. They don't have to fight the river current that way. My fishing partner, the vet and his trusty sidekick Benni watched the net while I went looking for some glacier ice. (I happened to find a couple of glass floats along the way along with some ice.) Anyway things were real slow. The vet went home so I watched the net until almost 10:00. We caught six fish.

This afternoon was different. We started fishing again at 4:00.By 7:30 we had 100 fish.

A fish has just hit the middle of the net in the picture above. That splashing means we just made some money. Sometimes the fish enter the net in deeper water. There is no splashing then but the floats on the surface begin to dance and you know there is a fish down there under it. We were excited when four or five floats went completely under a couple of times. Just imagine how many fish that would mean were in the net.....WRONG... a seal had snuck in and was robbing the fish out of the net. It tore a hole about 18 inches in diameter in the net but didn't cause any other problem.

I got up early again to catch the incoming tide.  In hind sight I could have stayed in bed. The fishing wasn't very good for anybody. Getting up early did allow me to catch a glimpse of a wolf this side of the river. The tracks showed there were two of them patrolling the beach.

No telling how long that little container of rations had floated around in the pacific. The nut flour ration tastes a little almondy. It will be good with coffee. The seed jelly has the texture of fudge but resembles strawberry preserves in flavor.

After two large loads of laundry I noticed a new feature in my yard. A miniature old faithful fountain has appeared! Imagine that.

Cut up a twenty foot log for firewood. I have learned that shorter pieces are a lot easier to split. I was a little worried about this log because there appeared to be many knots in the wood. That could make it hard to split. I don't know what kind of tree it was but the knots are no problem. It is a relief when you want a warm fire to not have to work up a sweat just to split the wood to get the fire.",AUGUST 1st,,publish,open,open,,august-1st-3,,,2013-08-02 08:41:37,2013-08-02 16:41:37,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=414,0,post,,2

I took a picture of the delicious meal the neighbors brought over last night.  I took the pic with the iPad.  I wanted to show all you folks back home what beer battered king salmon and fresh caught halibut over fluffy rice with a home made rubarb sauce on top looked like. That was followed with delicious carrot cake. (I think) Anyway, after breakfast of pancakes and lunch of pancakes it was truly appreciated.  The picture came over OK but there are issues with entering text.  No real problem though.  My trusty tech support team back home is on it.

When I bought the place the fiberglass shower stall was buried in the back corner of the workshop. It took a month to clear out all the other stuff to get to it. The shower had been damaged in a couple for places so I needed a fiberglass repair kit. I bought that and the valve while in Anchorage in June. The pump I mail ordered drew too much current for bank of batteries so I had to send that back and order another one on-line.

To drain the water from the shower and washer I needed to dig a trench for the pipe that runs out to the French drain that looks like the miniature ""Old Faithful"" when a large load of water Is discharged from the washer. The hot water heater arrived last week so finally all the pieces were here to plumb in the shower.

Now the shower in in the front corner of the workshop. The water is hot enough to keep the cool air off your skin while out there. It is a short dash back inside to the wood stove to dry off.

As the fishing begins to slow down here on the East Alsek river for some other things begin to kick into gear.  Most of the fishermen are leaving the river soon to (a) go back to their homes in the lower states.  (b) fish in other rivers. (c) get ready to host clients at sport fishing camps.

I am getting ready to go down to Juneau to meet my sweetheart.  We will be back up here in Dry Bay in a few days.  She plans to stay a couple of weeks.  Now you know why getting the hot water heater and shower installed was a priority.

The last two weeks there have been some noticeable changes outside.  There used to be dozens of hummingbirds.  Now I only see one a couple of times each day.  I hope it can find its way south.  The others have all gone that way already.  I'm beginning to see family groups of geese flying south.  There are new birds showing up that were not here a few days ago.  It is darker outside now at 10 p.m. than it was at midnight a while back. In the evenings the sun, as it sets, is creeping noticeably farther south each day.

As the fishing begins to slow down here on the East Alsek river for some other things begin to kick into gear.  Most of the fishermen are leaving the river soon to (a) go back to their homes in the lower states.  (b) fish in other rivers. (c) get ready to host clients at sport fishing camps.

I am getting ready to go down to Juneau to meet my sweetheart.  We will be back up here in Dry Bay in a few days.  She plans to stay a couple of weeks.  Now you know why getting the hot water heater and shower installed was a priority.

The last two weeks there have been some noticeable changes outside.  There used to be dozens of hummingbirds.  Now I only see one a couple of times each day.  I hope it can find its way south.  The others have all gone that way already.  I'm beginning to see family groups of geese flying south.  There are new birds showing up that were not here a few days ago.  It is darker outside now at 10 p.m. than it was at midnight a while back. In the evenings the sun, as it sets, is creeping noticeably farther south each day. 

I'm having a hard time with the idea of this incredible summer I have had beginning to wind down.

yesterday was the last day of fishing on the East River until next week.  The number of fish have really dropped off.  People are hoping some new fish will push in but historically it is about time for the sockeye to give way to the silver salmon.

I was able to hitch a ride on the plane that hauls the fish from Dry Bay to Yakutat.  That saved a few bucks.  At the airport I found out I had booked my flight to Juneau for tomorrow.  That cost a few bucks.  So for the day I broke even on that part.

I checked into the motel and noticed several things I found to be humorous.  The carpet on the floors.  I have been walking around on plywood floors and had forgotten how carpet feels under bare feet.  What I have been feeling is sandy plywood.  There were three people in line at the registration desk.  Where I have been there are no lines to get into.

My birthday celebration meal consisted of two hamburgers...it had been a while.  In the fish plane mail delivery I received a book.  ""GLACIER WOLF"" there was no information on who may have sent it.  If that person happens to read this, thank you very much.  A nice birthday surprise.  Another birthday gift...the rental car guy noticed on my drivers license it is my birthday...he gave me a five percent discount. Another nice thought.  In six more years I won't have to take my shoes off to get through airport security.

Stocking up on provisions in Juneau went well. Getting them here to Dry Bay didn't go as smoothly. Alaska Airlines allows 3 free bags per passenger for in state trips. The only exceptions are over sized and over weight bags. We bought one of those large marine coolers. I thought it was pretty heavy when I went to check in. It weighed 127 pounds. That meant I had to run out and buy another tote to put some of the food stuff in. Now, between us we checked 5 bags but 3 of them were over 50 pounds. Those three bags cost $150.00 in added fees. The short flight from Juneau to Yakutat left time for only a couple of card games on the iPad. Guess who left their iPad in the pocket of the seat in front of him. We did catch a fish plane flight back to Dry Bay so that part of the trip went off without any hitches.

Yesterday afternoon Cheryl found another glass ball on the beach. She is also starting a collection of ""special and unusual"" bottles that wash up out of the pacific.

Today we took both wheelers across the East River and went the 12 miles down the outer beach to the ""rocks"" We didn't find any treasures but we did come across some huge trees that had washed ashore. One of them had this really beautiful root system. It was so intricate. The roots had surrounded many rock and the sand and surf had polished it to an almost furniture smooth finish.

On the way back we came upon a neighbor and his girlfriend out there. Their Honda had broken down and they couldn't raise anyone on the VHF radio. We towed them back down the beach and across the East River. This same neighbor has had a pretty good season fishing. I asked him where I might catch a fish for dinner. He put me on a spot where I caught the first silver salmon of the season with a fly rod. If my friend keeps up the good work, I might even show her where that spot is.",AUGUST 14th,,publish,open,open,,august-14th,,,2013-08-14 21:23:17,2013-08-15 05:23:17,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=452,0,post,,1

The only exceptions are over sized and over weight bags.  We bought one of those large marine coolers.  I thought it was pretty heavy when I went to check in.  It weighed 127 pounds.  That meant I had to run out and buy another tote to put some of the food stuff in.  Now, between us we checked 5 bags but 3 of them were over 50 pounds.  Those three bags cost $150.00 in added fees.  The short flight from Juneau to Yakutat left time for only a couple of card games on the iPad.  Guess who left their iPad in the pocket of the seat in front of him.  We did catch a fish plane flight back to Dry Bay so that part of the trip went off without any hitches.

Yesterday afternoon Cheryl found another glass ball on the beach.  She is also starting a collection of ""special and unusual"" bottles that wash up out of the pacific.

Today we took both wheelers across the East River and went the 12 miles down the outer beach to the ""rocks""  We didn't find any treasures but we did come across some huge trees that had washed ashore.  One of them had this really beautiful root system.  It was so intricate.  The roots had surrounded many rock and the sand and surf had polished it to an almost furniture smooth finish.

On the way back we came upon a neighbor and his girlfriend out there.  Their Honda had broken down and they couldn't raise anyone on the VHF radio.  We towed them back down the beach and across the East River. This same neighbor has had a pretty good season fishing.  I asked him where I might catch a fish for dinner.  He put me on a spot where I caught the first silver salmon of the season with a fly rod.  If my friend keeps up the good work, I might even show her where that spot is.

It was a long way from Grape Nuts. With Cheryl here my Grape Nuts cache may last until next year. I just counted. I only have eleven and a half boxes left.

Today's plan was to finish some letters to the park service about Dry Bay residents concerns then begin work on the new outhouse. I got started on the letters, then a neighbor stopped in. After a nice visit we thought maybe last night's high tide may have washed in a glass ball so we went beachcombing. No joy with the glass ball but we did load up on glacier ice for the coolers.

Today there was this log with a different texture and color than most I see out there. Some of this wood would make beautiful furniture.

Back at the cabin I called the vet to see if he needed some ice for his coolers. He came over for the surplus ice and talked us into going fishing. We caught a couple. I released them. Maybe next time I commercial fish I will keep a few to smoke and send home to Colorado.

By late afternoon I did get the letters finished. We traveled the back trails to the neighbors for dinner. The way home seemed much shorter. Maybe the two bourbon and waters had something to do with that.

Down stream there was a lot going on. We first noticed two bears, then another pair came into view, then they all ran off in the same direction. Out of the brush on the left a huge brown bear came into view. I understand they have their favorite fishing spots and I guess the others were in his spot.

It is a shame there is such a weak market for Pink Salmon.  The fishing was good this morning.  This afternoon I caught the same number of Chum salmon ($.48 per pound) as I did sockeye ($1.48 per pound) and as many Pink Salmon as the other two combined ($0.00 per pound).  I changed nets this morning.  Using a larger size (5.5"" vs 5.25"") mesh lets smaller fish swim through the net.  The larger mesh also makes it some easier to get the Pinks out of the net.  No telling how many Pinks I would have had to pick if I had stayed with the smaller mesh.

The biggest catch of the day in volume and in weight was moss.  The clear water and the very warm weather we have been having has caused the river to produce an enormous crop of moss.  As the tide goes in and out, along with the river's current the net catches moss from both directions.  The river actually flows backwards when there is a strong incoming tide.  So, the moss that flowed down stream on an outgoing tide, comes back upstream on the next incoming tide.  There is so much sometime all you do is pull the boat back and forth along the net shaking the moss out of the net.  When the net is clogged with moss it is VERY heavy and the fish just won't go into the net.

Bottom line is today was my last day of commercial fishing for this year.  Cheryl and I hope to catch enough sockeye sport fishing to smoke a batch.  The way the sockeye run has dropped off I may end up smoking silver salmon.  That will be OK but they are not as tasty as the sockeye.

Bottom line is today was my last day of commercial fishing for this year.  Cheryl and I hope to catch enough sockeye sport fishing to smoke a batch.  The way the sockeye run has dropped off I may end up smoking silver salmon.  That will be OK but they are not as tasty as the sockeye.

I got a note today that a man whom I admired and who also dearly loved the outdoors passed away.  Peter Weil will be missed.",AUGUST 19th,,inherit,open,open,,476-revision,,,2013-08-19 21:56:51,2013-08-20 05:56:51,,476,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/08/19/476-revision/,0,revision,,0

Three of us had been commercial fishing this week. Yesterday was my last day. The fishing was slow and with Cheryl here I thought we could be spending our time in better ways. More about that shortly. Today is apparently the last day for the other two fishermen. On the commercial side there just are not enough fish moving up the river to make it worth while.

However, on the sport fishing side things were different for us.

We went upstream from where the commercial fishing is allowed. There is a large confluence of two streams there that make a shallow lake. It is probably a half mile across in one place. That water was full of fish. The fishing was difficult. The water is about three feet deep and the moss is about one foot deep. So you have two feet of clear water to swim your fly or lure through without getting all tangled up in the moss. We finally got it figured out with the right weight lure and retrieve speed.

We will probably go back up there....nope we will go back up there in the next day or so. This time we will try to use lures that float on the surface. The silver (Coho) salmon we were catching were particular about what color fly we were using. If it was bright pink they would attack it. Other colors they tended to ignore. One of the fly rods we were using is a 5 weight. What that means is it is designed to be used on fish in the 1 to 5 pound range (my opinion). These salmon today were running up to 12 pounds. On that light tackle it took a while to land these guys.

Cheryl did a great job all around. Casting, hooking, landing and releasing the fish we didn't want to keep. We stopped fishing when we had eight. Fileted them at the cabin and had beer battered salmon with rice and vegies for dinner. Very very good. The plan is to smoke the rest. It is going to be hard to stay at the cabin and tend the smoker with all those other fish up there. Life is so tough sometime.

One other thing.  While we were fishing there was a bear on the other side of the lake.  It was fishing too.  The bear would walk along in the water then suddenly charge ahead, water flying in every direction then it would walk again.  I'm sure it was chasing fish.  It was too far away to be able to tell if he caught any.  I bet it did though.  Why spend all that energy with no reward.",AUGUST 20th,,publish,open,open,,august-20th,,,2013-08-20 20:34:16,2013-08-21 04:34:16,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=484,0,post,,2

We caught our limit of silvers again today.  Cheryl limited out first and she also caught the biggest fish.  I thought today when I quit taking her fish off the hook I might be able to overcome her angling advantage over me.  Not so.  She still out fished me.  I enjoy listening to her tell the fish she is being as gentle as she can be while taking the hook out.  She and the fish also converse, or seemingly so, when she is releasing one back into the river.  They both enjoy that.

It stood up in the middle of the road as I approached on the Honda.

This is the second time the smoker has been used this year.  It is a plywood cube about 4 feet on each side.  Colorado neighbor, Rick, used it earlier.  With this smoker you build the fire in an improvised (old Honda wheel) container directly under the fish which are on racks near the top of the cube.  So to add wood to the little smoking fire you have to open the door.  When that happens all the smoke comes pouring out, the little fire may flair up and you are blind for a few seconds from all the escaping smoke.

This morning we vacuumed the salmon that got smoked yesterday afternoon and evening.  The high tides and the erosion they cause called us back out onto the beach to beachcomb.  I don't know why that is so relaxing and if you find something interesting even more so.

Cheryl found this one and just a few yards from where I found one to.  When we got back to the cabin one of the neighbors came by.  He asked if we had heard the latest about Cheryl's flight out on Monday.  We had not.  Yesterday I sent a note to the bush pilot asking to reconfirm the time she would be picked up.  Turned out the office staff and the pilot were not on the same page.  The earliest they could pick her up was Wednesday afternoon.  

Having no sat phone, all I could do was email or use Skype to contact them.  After some juggling of things the office asked if we could be ready to go at 4:00 this afternoon.  To quote Cheryl, ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" we said we could be ready.  When asked where the pilot should meet us we checked the tide tables and discovered there was no way he could land in front of the cabin as hoped. (see the pic from yesterday)  There would be way too much water on the beach runway.  So that meant we needed to drive over to the fish plant across Dry Bay.  The high tide also meant we had to go the long way.  A forty minute ride.  It was already after two.  She got her stuff together and I packed the cooler with fish.  

Earlier I had sold the old outboard to a guy in Yakutat.  How to get it to him was a problem.  Since Cheryl was being picked up in a larger plane there was room for the outboard too.  There is no way I could lift a 75 hp outboard almost 5 feet into the air by myself.  I got on the VHF radio and in just a few minutes a couple of neighbors showed up.

By now it was raining steadily.  It was after three.  We had to take the long way to the plant to meet the pilot at four.  In case the plane was early, one neighbor blasted off to let the pilot know we were on the way.  The other neighbor followed behind Cheryl and me, watching to be sure nothing fell off the trailer I was pulling, with the outboard on it.  We got to the plant with a little time to spare.  Then we started waiting.  The clouds had gotten lower and it was raining harder by now.  Four thirty came and went.  We had no way to get in touch with anyone since the fish plant is closed for the season.  We heard a plane coming..it just flew on by.  We were wondering if the weather was so bad the pilot had turned back.  Do we keep waiting or go back home? Finally at nearly five we could tell from the sound our plane was coming in.

Some dear friends in Yakutat picked up Cheryl.  I thought they would just take her the short distance to the terminal and she would be on her way to Colorado.  Not to be.  It seems an Alaskan cruise ship has broken down south of here and some 3,100 people are trying to get home.  From the news I read some planes have been chartered to get those folks out.  As of this writing what I thought would be an easy ticket exchange might turn into an extended stay in Yakutat for Cheryl.

I will probably know something specific tomorrow.  We are fortunate the friends in Yakutat have a freezer. Sixty or seventy pounds of fish can't stay frozen on a cooler forever.

I returned all the stuff I had borrowed from the neighbors.  That last trip to Juneau enabled me to buy what I had used, bearings, plumbing and electrical parts etc. It was no problem returning things to those neighbors who have already left.  Everyone just closes up their cabins and arrange some way to keep the doors from blowing open.  No locks required.  We are so remote here there would be no point in locking things up.  A lock or boarded window would just slow a thief down a little.  No one has ever had a problem with things disappearing.

Yesterday and again today I found gaffs that had washed ashore.  These tools are used by fishermen to pull fish aboard the fishing boats at sea.  Wooden handles about two feet long with a stainless steel, pointed hook on the end.

The one neighbor who was home gave me some firewood.  Using his trailer I made a wrong turn crossing a slough and stuck the wheeler in some wet sand.  The machine was down to the frame in the quicksand with this trailer full of wood behind it.  Fortunately the trailer was still on a solid surface of gravel.  By unhooking the trailer I got the wheeler unstuck by lifting alternately the front then the back of the machine.  By raising it just a little enough of the liquid sand would run under the wheels that I could get it out.  From a new spot I  pulled the trailer backwards till I could get hooked back up again. 

Just before I got stuck I was able to watch a single Trumpter Swan across the slough for a few minutes.  The camera is acting up so the pictures I took are poor.  I may go back with the better camera and try again.

Cheryl is in the air somewhere over British Columbia as I type this.  She was able to change tickets at no cost and will arrive back in Boulder a day earlier than planned.  Neighbor Joe stopped by for a few minutes late this afternoon.  As he was leaving the jet Cheryl is on flew over.  We waved but between the clouds and her altitude she probably didn't see us.

The weasel was hunting around the wood pile this afternoon.  The little stream in front of the cabin is Dog Salmon Creek.  Today I saw three salmon summing up it to spawn.  According to the old timers the silver salmon should start coming in in big numbers over the next few days.  It will be enjoyable to have these magnificent fish swim by the front door.

506,3,2013-08-26 23:22:09,2013-08-27 07:22:09,"A nice day mostly.  A little shower this afternoon while I was fishing, just enough to force the rain gear out of the tote on the back of the wheeler.

I thought the fishing would be especially good at first.  I caught two nice silvers in the first 15 minutes.  A half hour later, after changing flies, another couple of hits.  Kept changing flies and catching a couple then they would get lock jaw.  I threw a pink top water bug at them for a while.  It is really exciting to see a wave of water, like an underwater torpedo or miniature submarine, racing toward your fly.  Several did this afternoon but would turn away at the last second.  I guess they were not into pink today.

I did hook a world record silver though.  I'm sure it was the world record.  It was a very large fish.  It gave me the best fight of the day.  Long runs, taking lots of line off the reel.  A very bright and silvery fish.  He was so big when he would run toward me I was looking for a way to get out of his way.  Huge fish....He got away.  I did end up catching and releasing six or seven.

Back at the cabin I checked the river out front.  One of the neighbors from across Dry Bay has a sport fishing facility.  He has an arrangement with an outfitter in Canada (Canada is only about 40 miles away by air).  This Canadian outfitter has clients from all over Europe.  Today he had six guys from Germany fishing here.  You know it must be an expensive trip to come here from Europe.  Those men, I am sure, are used to life's finer things.

There were no fish down at the mouth of the East River this afternoon. Up stream a little ways I hooked up with a ""runner"". That fish hit the fly as soon as it hit the water and it never slowed down till it had nearly all the line off the reel. I did manage to get him turned then he threw the hook.

It was bright enough that I could see things around the outside of the cabin even though there was no moon. The night was very, exceptionally clear. The bluish light was starlight. I went outside and could see the Milky Way stretch across the sky above. One cold winter night years ago Peter and I could see the Milky Way from the deck in Colorado. Last night was the second time I recall ever seeing it. Our planet is just one in the millions that make up our galaxy. I was seeing in the Milky Way just a part of our neighborhood. Makes one feel sort of small.

Good progress in the ""privy"" today. If I don't have too many interruptions (two unplanned coffee breaks and one urgent fishing report today) I may get the roof started tomorrow. I really don't mind the interruptions. A discussion in one of the coffee breaks resulted in my decision to install a FDS* in the outhouse. I had been considering an FDS* but the fine tuning of the design was completed during the coffee breaks.

I had to wait to take action on the urgent fishing report. Determined to get the third wall of the structure covered I was finally able to hit the river about 5:30. Large pods of fish were moving upstream. I lost count of how many the Vet and I caught. One of the other old timers was watching us fish. There were so many fish coming through I told this observer ""I'm going to catch a fish in the next two casts."" I didn't need to make the second cast. I cast a floating fly at them for a while. I had several fish attack the fly but failed to hook any of them.

I had been considering an FDS* but the fine tuning of the design was completed during the coffee breaks.

I had to wait to take action on the urgent fishing report. Determined to get the third wall of the structure covered I was finally able to hit the river about 5:30. Large pods of fish were moving upstream. I lost count of how many the Vet and I caught. One of the other old timers was watching us fish. There were so many fish coming through I told this observer ""I'm going to catch a fish in the next two casts."" I didn't need to make the second cast. I cast a floating fly at them for a while. I had several fish attack the fly but failed to hook any of them.

Cheryl took this picture last week. My cabin is just off the left side of this shot. This afternoon I was caching these fish just a few yards from where the eagle is sitting. This would have been a good day for anyone reading this to have been here.

Wild Flower, Hazel Creek, Good Times and I were treated to dinner at the Vet's cabin this evening.  The Vet's VHF handle is ""The Old Fart"".  Pork Chops, Chicken Fingers, potatoes and gravy, corn, two kinds of homemade bread and tapioca pudding for dessert. It was delicious and very much appreciated by all of us. I told the others I would host a meal before they leave on Wednesday.  The entry would be Grape Nuts.  I think they all said they would be leaving before I could get things ready and to not bother.

The fall bear hunting season starts tomorrow.  That means there might be a little more plane traffic in the area.  The hunting laws prohibit shooting game the same day you fly.  But the guides use their planes to narrow down where to hunt the following day.  

Good Times is hosting the first annual football bash at his cabin tomorrow night.  Good Times has a big screen TV.  We don't know who is playing.  We don't know what time the game might start. The bash was to start at 6:00 but at dinner tonight the fact that we are 4 hours earlier than Eastern time caused the bash time to be moved to 4:00.  I'm taking an unopened bottle of Maker's Mark Kentucky Bourbon.  It is about 4 miles through the Alder brush on an narrow trail to Good Time's cabin.  I should probably go easy on the MM cause it will be dark by the time I head home.

The rain kept me inside today.  The electrical wiring in the cabin was very, very basic.  One wire connected all the lights and outlets with no fuse in the system.  Now there is a circuit breaker panel and the lights and outlets are on separate circuits.  It still wouldn't pass Boulders building code but it is much better and safer than before.

Yesterday I described the wonderful meal the Vet prepared.  Today ""Good Times"" had us over to watch football and have dinner.  Scallops wrapped in bacon, tenderloin, rice, fresh tomatoes and apple-berry pie for dessert. Very delicious.  Denver was playing Phoenix.  One of the men, from Phoenix, wanted to bet on the outcome.  I passed.  Good thing too.  It seems the game was played last Thursday and he already knew the outcome.

Three of the fishermen will fly out for the season Thursday morning.  The plane will pick them up here in front of my cabin.  That means they will be bringing all the stuff they are taking out over here on Wednesday.  They will each close up their cabins early Thursday morning and meet here. I will be blessed/cursed with their extra perishable food. Since I will be the last one out of here I may end up hauling all that extra food to Yakutat where I'm sure there are some people who could use it.

As I left for the football bash, there were two Bald Eagles in the air right out in front of the cabin. I don't know if they were in a dispute, playing or courting.  To see these large raptors, their talons locked together, tumbling through the sky....  As they flew one would seem to be dominate then the other one would gain some advantage.  In my mind's eye this lasted a while.  In real time it was only seconds.  Have been sitting here replaying that in my mind for the last fifteen minutes.  I'm sorry I can't pull the words out to describe how spectacular that sight was.

The Gala Grand Opening of the new outhouse got postponed for a day. In the picture below there are two KUBOTA vehicles. These utility machines are fancy ATVs with a cab, windshield and short hauling bed in back. The one farther away with the people is stuck. Down to the frame in sand. The nearer one has been trying to pull the one stuck out with a winch. The rope out the back of the close one is connected to an anchor to keep in in place. None of that worked. We were able to move the stuck machine only a little. The way we finally got it out was to take my trusty Honda around in front of the disabled machine and push while the second Kubota pulled with the winch.  The stream on the far right in both these pictures is the East Alsek river.  Thousands of pounds of Sockeye Salmon were caught in this stream right where the first machine is mired down.

Wild Flower is packing his cabin up for the winter and is using one of my Hondas so he can store his while everything is dry.

The way we finally got it out was to take my trusty Honda around in front of the disabled machine and push while the second Kubota pulled with the winch.  The stream on the far right in both these pictures is the East Alsek river.  Thousands of pounds of Sockeye Salmon were caught in this stream right where the first machine is mired down.

Wild Flower is packing his cabin up for the winter and is using one of my Hondas so he can store his while everything is dry. On the way over to his cabin I spotted these five Trumpeter Swans in the slough near his cabin. There will be more and more of these wild swans passing through in the next few weeks.

Stuff I haven't had to think about before.

It has been interesting watching these three men getting ready to leave.  One is still running around trying to get everything done that should have been done weeks ago.  Another is visiting those of us who are staying, saying good by with story telling and reliving the summer.  The third is riding around on the wheeler, paying a last visit to some of the beautiful places he won't see again for seven months.

These planes went out of production in 1967 but hundreds of them are still flying. Designed as a bush plane its powerful rotary engine allowed for a short takeoff and landing.

I believe some time ago I mentioned a green bucket that was along the side of the East River near the mouth. When I got here in May the bucket was about eight feet from the edge of a drop off into the river. On August 17th I took this picture of that bucket. It was about two feet from the edge then.

Last night the high tide and river's currents caused the bucket to drop off into the river. In four months the river moved northwest eight feet. Farther up the beach the Alsek river is moving southeast at an even faster clip. This may continue or some storm or earth quake may change all this overnight.

A month ago there was a meeting between the Dry Bay fishermen and the Park Rangers. As a result a couple of letters were written asking for permission to erect wood storage facilities at those cabins that needed a place to store firewood.

I'm calling that picture ""After the Storm"". Heavy rain, strong winds, three days in a row. A Coloradoan's song popped into my head this morning; Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy. It did. Thanks John Denver.

The water was up into the grass this morning as I was visiting with Cheryl on a video hookup. About 8:45 the plane that came to pick up the Vet and his two friends arrived. It circled a couple of times down by Mike's Cabin then started making passes over my place. I signed off with Cheryl and via the VHF radio asked the pilot if he wanted me to run the Honda out into the water to show him how deep it was so he could land. He said no but could I get in touch with Mike. Mike had closed down his cabin and there was no radio contact. Then the pilot proceeded to land in front of my cabin.

I hooked up one of the trailers, put a tote on it, and proceeded toward the flooding creek in front of the house. The normally shallow crossing point was so deep I strapped the tote to the trailer so it would not float off.  If the water had been any deeper I would have had to dismount and float the Honda and trailer across. At Mike's we filled the tote with luggage and boxes of frozen fish. One of the guests and I went back to creek with this first load. I waded the creek and walked back to the my cabin and got the second Honda and another trailer and tote. We carried the lighter bags across the creek and floated the heavier stuff across in the tote. Now I had half the stuff on the side of the creek with the plane and the guest had an empty tote to use to get the rest of the fish and luggage. Same routine this second time. The only thing left to bring across was one of the guests who had on boots but didn't have waders. Mike had this guy step into an empty tote and he pushed the guest and the tote across the creek. I went back to them  and loaded the tote while the man waited in a spot of shallower water, he hopped back into the tote and was delivered, dry feet and all, to the plane( I think his boots were tall enough to keep his feet dry).... Now I have one Honda on each side of the creek. Up here a guy can't have too many Hondas.

Spent the afternoon laying the rest of the laminate flooring. I put down about half of it in May and since I couldn't go anywhere because of the high water I finally finished the job.

Was enjoying a libation while I watched the sun go down this afternoon. Sat the empty cup on the step of the workshop. I stepped away to get a better camera angle and the cup came tumbling down the steps into the yard. Guess who is back?

These little critters are so curious and so fast. An old guy chasing one with a broom must be great sport for them. Exasperating for the old guy.

If the water goes down enough tonight, tomorrow I will put the waders back on, wade the creek, get the Honda and do some serious beachcombing. The rain, wind and high tides surely have left some treasures out there for me.

As I type this Boulder is shut down because of an extremely heavy rain storm. Boulder averages about 18 inches of rain each year. The last couple of days some parts of the area got eleven inches. People in my neighborhood can not get out because of washed out roads. All the rain here just kept me indoors and that was my choice. Not so for the people at home.

Today was bright and sunny here. Beachcombing was high on my list for this morning. When I got to one of the better spots I found someone had been there before me.

As I type this Boulder is shut down because of an extremely heavy rain storm. Boulder averages about 18 inches of rain each year. The last couple of days some parts of the area got eleven inches. People in my neighborhood can not get out because of washed out roads. All the rain here just kept me indoors and that was my choice. Not so for the people at home.

Today was bright and sunny here. Beachcombing was high on my list for this morning. When I got to one of the better spots I found someone had been there before me.

Saw a couple of bears nearby today. The one in the picture was a fair size bear. It had some sort of growth on his snout. It didn't seem to keep him from finding salmon in the river though.

600,3,2013-09-17 13:37:39,2013-09-17 21:37:39,"I had not planned for this wonderful summer in Dry Bay to end this way.

Last Wednesday it started to rain in Boulder, Colorado where my home is. This unprecedented storm dumped as much rain in the next four days as we normally get in some years.  Many of the roads are washed out.  Others are impassable because of rock and mud slides.  Some mountain communities  are completely cutoff with no utilities including water available.

The Sheriff  and fire departments encouraged all residents in my neighborhood and those surrounding to evacuate once egress-able routes were opened.  Once one did leave there was no way to return.  Cheryl decided she should leave and stay with a friend of her's in a nearby town.  With that information received via email I decided I had better get back to Boulder.

Had the one last neighbor I could reach with the VHF radio call the bush flying service on their sat phone and arrange for me to be picked up at four Saturday afternoon.  I got to Seattle about midnight and got back into Denver at six Sunday night.

We are staying in Longmont, Colorado where there is currently no Internet service due to the flood.  I will post this when I get to a place where I can.

For me it was a painful way to have to end my summer at the cabin.  Rushing to get everything closed up and winterized.  Unable to ease back into a mind set that accepts long lines, poor service, traffic, crowds.   I feel like I must have left all my patience with this real world some place where I haven't been able to find it yet.

When I can get back home I'll send out another note to close this season of Notes from Alaska.

The officials allowed people who live in the flooded areas around Boulder back into their homes today.  We were lucky to be able to stay with a friend of Cheryl's instead of having to rent a room someplace.  By 10:30 this morning we had been to the store for provisions, stopped and picked up the 30 pounds of frozen salmon we had stashed in another friends freezer, had negotiated the morning traffic and a security roadblock.  In our neighborhood we walked past a washed out spot on the road to our house.  The plan was to get the Honda ATV and trailer, go back to the car and haul all the stuff in the car home.  The Honda had a dead battery.  So while Cheryl said Hail Marys (she isn't even Catholic) I drove the car around the washout home.

All the streams have new features now.  It looks like the creek below the house was four or five feet deep at one time.  Normally it is just a trickle this time of year.

But back to thoughts of the summer.  One of my favorite memories was of the Cow moose spending the night on a sand bar in the middle of the East River.  She stayed out there with her twin baby calves in order to see any predator that might be around.  Another favorite was the group of Brant geese that flew along side me as I went down the beach on the wheeler.  They stayed abreast of me for quite a ways.  When I would change speeds so would they.  When I stopped they landed beside me.  That was really special.

If you have been following this you know how much I have marveled at the wonders of nature I witnessed. But I must not wind this journal down without acknowledging the people that shared Dry Bay, Alaska with me.  They bailed me out more times than they should have.  They kept me from needing to be bailed out more than that.  When I did screw up they would smile and say, ""we have all done that, sometimes more than once.""

So with that in mind I plan to be back up there next May.  I need to keep practicing.

607,3,2013-05-21 22:17:23,2013-05-22 06:17:23,"A very beautiful day in Alaska.  There are two jet flights into Yakutat each day.  The morning, northbound, flight originates in Seattle, stops in Juneau, Yakutat, Cordova and ends in Anchorage.  That same plane turns around, southbound, and makes those same stops on the way back to Seattle.  I had a very busy morning getting a lot of shopping done for the cabin and caught the southbound back to Yakutat.

It was clear all the way from Anchorage.  I sat on the left side of the plane so I could see the continuous mountain ranges below.  They all still have snow on them down to about 1,000 feet.  As these warm days come more often one can see the snow line rise up the mountains each day.  Between Anchorage and the cabin there must be at least 50 coastal glaciers.  The rivers that flow from them to the sea are all a light gray color from the silt created by the glacier as it grinds across the stones.  Those rivers all have icebergs in them.  Some the size of garbage cans.  Some appear to be as big as city blocks.  The ice sheet at the head of some of these glaciers is the largest in North America.  To see all that white snow and ice then land at the cabin which sits in a temperate rain forest....we live on an amazing planet.

Neighbor, Harold met me at the airport and we flew on down to the cabin in his plane. The ghost of my extracted tooth was haunting me so I took some medicine to chase it away.  The weasel was here and greeted me with some news.  There is clear plastic stapled to the ceiling joists that holds the insulation up.  I could see the weasel moving around on top of the clear plastic but below the insulation.  As I watched I noticed some more movement above the plastic.

She had a litter of little weasels up there.  Harold's grandson and his girlfriend came over to see the litter.  Harold's son, Pat, wanted me to catch the weasels and put them in another neighbor's house.  I decided not to do that.

We positioned a deep Rubbermaid tub under the nest and cut the plastic around the nest.  The seven little weasels and the mother weasel all fell into the tub.  We took them about a hundred yards from the cabin and turned the tub on its side.  Out pops mom with a little weasel in her mouth.  She ran into the woods with it.  We left her alone and in maybe 15 minutes she had moved all seven of her pups(?) to some other place.

I came back from Anchorage with the parts to install another well.  This one will have an electric pump attached.  There may be running water at the cabin soon.  More about that another time.

Thanks for the kind comments about these ramblings.  I enjoy telling these stories.

608,3,2013-05-28 23:00:36,2013-05-29 07:00:36,"Not much going on today except for all the wheel spinning I did.  I added some old gas to the generator and changed its oil.  When I restarted it it ran for about five minutes and would stop.  There is a sensor that shuts the engine down if the oil level is low.  I checked that.  The oil was OK.  Then  I decided it must have been bad gas I had added.  After pumping the old ""bad"" gas out and refilling the tank she fired right up. Five minutes later it shut down again.  I drained the carburetor thinking there might have some bad gas accumulated there.  Same problem.  I checked the oil again. It appeared frothy.  I had used some premium aircraft oil that was here at the cabin.  I drained the ""premium"" oil and refilled with plane ole 30 weight.  The generator has been running fine ever since.

Today was the day to get the fishing boat running.  More wheel spinning.  I cleaned out a gas tank.  Added the oil and gas mixture in the proper ratios.  Put the tank in the boat.  It was the wrong kind of tank.  Found the right type tank but then couldn't get the gas to flow to the engine.  Figured that out and now it runs fine.

The boat has some air chambers welded into it to keep it afloat should you get swamped.  Some water had seeped into those chambers.  There are two bolts one removes to drain that water.  I took the bolts out.  The water drained but due to corrosion or who knows what they would not tighten back up in their holes.  Those two bolts are now held in place wit roofing sealer.

The air temperature and water temperature are such that a fog has suddenly appeared then will disappear just as quickly.  That has been going on all day.  There is no wind so this fog just happens.  It is kind of weird.  Right now I can't see the creek in front of the cabin.

Rain is in the forecast.  There are a few pressing outdoor chores I would like to get done then I won't feel bad about staying inside and doing some administrative stuff.

I saw the bears the first time when I was putting my fishing boat in the water. It is a very heavy duty home made aluminum boat about 18 feet long. Up here there is an ingenious way of building the boats so a trailer is not required to move them across the land. Two automobile wheels on short stubby axles slide into pockets near the back of the boat. You back the boat into the water, slide the wheels out and you are on your way. To go across land again, just park the boat in shallow water, slide the wheels back in and go. Very simple...in my case the shallow water required was deeper than my boots were tall. No real problem since my wet feet were close to home.

After running the boat up and down the river a couple of times I came back to shore a little to fast. One second I am headed toward the shallow water on shore. Next second I'm looking at the sky. The boat has a very wide flat bottom for stability. When it runs aground one stops in a lot less than a New York minute. Well the boat stopped and I didn't till the space between the front and back seat benches caught me.

My neighbor Pat came over to help me get my nets in order for the season opener for salmon on Sunday. It is very complicated. The regulations are reasonable considering the catch has to be managed so enough salmon get through to spawn and sustain the fishery. For a newbe like me trying to understand webbing, fathoms and mesh depth which can all vary depending on the water you are fishing and the targeted fish. I have thought enough about it today.

Later we took my boat over to the Alsek river (a huge fast river). On the way one of those wheels fell off. We got it back on without a lot of trouble. As I approached the cabin coming back the two bears were on my side of the river. Charlie, the neighbor's bear dog spotted them. Charlie weighs maybe 50 pounds. She went tearing out after these two grizzly bears. At first they just watch her barreling toward themselves. Then they seem to think, ""who is that little thing kidding""? But she is coming at them so fast and seems so determined the two bears turn tail and run right into and across the river. Charlie came back looking very proud of herself.

Today we were supposed to fly out to the cabin. The plan was to be at the Juneau airport early and pack the single engine plane with two SUV loads of provisions. We would then fly northwest for an hour, land on the beach, taxi up to the cabin and unload all the stuff we had been accumulating over the past several weeks....no, make that months.

Well...Mother Nature has gotten involved in our best laid plans. She has decided to rain and snow and blow so that small planes can't fly. They may not fly for several days.

Two days ago the weather was beautiful. Nature is so close all around up here. Yesterday We saw 12 Bald Eagles sitting in the same tree. The Mendenhall glacier is just four miles up the road. The air is so fresh here it seems the source of it must be very near by.

This is the first ""official"" note I have entered in this electronic journal. I'll add to it from time to time. The plan is to share with my family and friends some of the wonderful things I come across here.","May 1, 2013",,inherit,open,open,,71-autosave-v1,,,2013-10-21 12:03:47,2013-10-21 20:03:47,,71,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/10/21/71-autosave-v1/,0,revision,,0
621,3,2013-05-21 07:07:15,2013-05-21 15:07:15,"MAY 15th. I have been keeping daily notes since May 4th but have not had internet access. Now that I do there are ten days of notes below. In the future there will not be nearly as much volume to read. Thanks for your interest.

MAY 4TH

Much has happened since I was able to add anything to this site. We were supposed to fly out to the cabin on May 1st. The weather was not cooperating so we stayed in Juneau another day. On the 2nd of May we were able to catch a flight to Gustavus and were treated to outstanding hospitality by our pilot and his wife. The clouds and fog were so dense visibility was near zero through a narrow pass called Icy Straights. The fog went all the way down to the surface of the sea….No place to be in a Cessna 206 single engine plane.

On Friday the 3rd. the weather forecast was very iffy. We were not sure when we might be able to get to the cabin. Considering that and a bunch of other details like, “once we get there will Cheryl be able to get out in time to make her connections back home” we decided she should just come on back home and I would make it out to the cabin whenever the weather would allow.

As nature would have it there was a break in weather and a narrow window opened and I got to the cabin about 3:00 Friday afternoon. It was raining. The weather service predicted 100% chance of rain, heavy at times. They were right. It rained, heavy at times, non-stop until 3:00 Saturday afternoon.

I have been spending much of my time just watching the spectacle in front of the cabin. As I type this there are three flocks of migrating birds in my front yard. There are nearly 100 Canada geese just to the left. Directly in front of me there is a flock of 37 Sandhill cranes and a little beyond them must be 50 Snow geese. Throughout the day I have watched this spectacle. Frequently I see a few Greater White-fronted geese mixed in with the others.

Bald Eagles appear fairly often. You can tell when one is approaching. All the birds feeding take to the air in one huge mass. As soon as the eagle has passed they all come back and resume feeding…right in my front yard.

I’m loving it.

MAY 5TH
Today would have been Mother’s birthday. She wouldn’t have liked it here but would have been happy that I’m able to enjoy all this nature.

It has stopped raining and the clouds are a little higher today. Late in the afternoon I did hear a small plane fly by. That means the weather must be moderating some.

Made good progress getting the outside cleaned up today. Over the years an assortment of plastic and fiberglass articles had accumulated. There were a few alder bushes that were blocking some of the view out the front. I had a heck of a bon fire going for a while. Some of that stuff made really dense black smoke.

Not such a variety of waterfowl out front today. There was a large flock of Canada geese out front late. I’m guessing 250 birds. They graze back and forth less than 100 feet from the front door.

As far as I can tell there is no one else here in the preserve. I check a neighboring cabin to see if their internet connection was working….it wasn’t.

MAY 6TH

Coolest morning yet. Thirty six outside. Forty seven inside. The stove works well and before long I’ll have it up in the middle 60s. There is some blue in the sky and I can see the mountains off in the east. There is beginning to be a tinge of green on the ground and the alders have little buds showing.

Decided to go down to the mouth of the Alsek River to look for glass floats. These baseball size glass balls used to be used to float the fishing nets used by the Japanese fishing off shore. I found a few.

On the way down the beech I saw my first bear of the season. At the mouth of the river a group of sea lions had gathered. The herd bull would frequently bellow or roar his presence. There seemed to be many young seals there too.

MAY 7TH

A beautiful blue sky morning with no wind. The heavy frost is quickly disappearing in the warm sunshine. Not many birds on the ground out front. It is unusual to look up into the sky and not see flocks of birds all heading the same way… North. As I type this an Osprey landed out front. The first humming bird just flew by. Got to get a feeder for them! Those sea lions mentioned yesterday…They are several miles away and I can hear them roaring here at the cabin.

Borrowed a neighbor’s hummingbird feeder. They are not here yet so I didn’t think they would mind. I put the feeder up about ten this morning. By noon several pairs had found it. All the hummers I have seen up here are the Rufous hummingbirds. We see them passing through Colorado in July.

I met another resident yesterday. I spent most of the day working on the storage area of the cabin. Hearing a little noise I discovered an Ermine (weasel) watching me. I hope she appreciates the redecorating.

Also discovered the freezer freezes and the washing machine washes.

MAY 8th
A little chilly this morning, 30 outside and 40 inside. Another beautiful morning. I was up around 4:15. The hummingbirds were already buzzing around outside wondering where their feeder was!

My neighbor flew down from Yakutat. He brought all the stuff I need to get the internet connection set up. He also brought provisions to begin stocking their cabin. He flew back to town and will return tomorrow with more supplies for his cabin. He will also bring the things to install the wood stove. I have been heating with an oil stove. With an endless supply of free fuel outside it seems silly to buy oil then have to fly it in.

While we were standing outside another resident came up from out of the woods. It was a fair size brown bear (grizzly). He went back into the brush before I could get some good close-up pictures.

MAY 9th

High human traffic today. The neighbor flew back in with a friend of his. He brought all the parts needed to install the wood stove. Now I have to decide if I want to use the old wood stove that was stored here or get a new one. It’s not only the cost of the stove but getting it here will be expensive too. A pilot we flew with last year stopped by. He had been delivering fuel to a bear hunter’s camp. He was flying a neat little “cub” that had skis attached just above the wheels. He could land on the beach or in the snow. A little later two of the guides from the bear hunter camp stopped. Whew! I didn’t get as much work done as I hoped.

Did get the attic emptied out. There was some high quality outdoor gear up there.

A couple of wildlife things. The hummers are drinking over a quart of food a day. The weasel was back in the cabin last night. I nearly swatted him with my cap as it scurried across the floor.

MAY 10th

Last night I installed new gaskets in the hand pump by the sink. Whenever I needed more water I had to pump that handle at least 50 times (I actually counted). This morning on the 7th stroke water appeared. That is so neat. To not have to work up a sweat to get a cup of water.

My neighbor has a portable saw mill. It comes in heal handy when you need more than a couple of boards that could be flown in on a small plane. Yesterday he found a fir log down on the beach over 40 feet long. Today we went down there, cut the log into 2 twenty footers rolled them onto an ingenious trailer and brought that huge log home to be sawed up into boards.

This afternoon we got all the internet hardware mounted on the house and the wiring done. I still don’t have a connection to the internet. We think it is because there are some trees blocking the clear view of the sky the satellite dish needs. So tomorrow I’ll be turning trees into firewood.

MAY 11th
I went down to the mouth of the Alsek this morning to do a little more beachcombing. Found one glass float that had appeared with the tide. A little later my neighbor stopped in. He had also gone down there. He found another glass float not twenty feet from where I found mine. I expect I was so pleased to find one I didn’t bother to look around for another so close.

The alder trees grow so quickly here they encroach on any clear space. So over the years they had invaded the space around the cabin clearing. I had been trimming them back for several days. Yesterday I spent quite a while burning them.

Nearby, the little weasel was very busy hunting for something.

My neighbor and his friend flew back to Yakutat around noon. He left the dog, Charlie, with me for the night. There had been a very light rain falling most of the day. When I went to bed it was pitch black inside. A little while later I could sense something very close. I turned on the light and Charlie was staring at me from a few inches away. Needless to say she wanted to be up off the floor. As far as I know she didn’t move all night….a good bed mate.

MAY 12th

I woke up this morning feeling an empty place. This is the first Mother’s Day in all these years that I have not been able to wish someone Happy Mother’s Day. To those Mothers who might read this …I hope you had a happy Mother’s Day.

A light rain has fallen all day. So, very major progress was made today on organizing the living space at the cabin. By the end of the week I hope to have a wood stove working, the shop side of the cabin organized and the internet working.

The rainy day has caused the humming birds to spend what seems like most of their time around the feeder. I filled the quart feeder after the birds went to bed last night. By 1:00 p.m. it was empty. It is nearly 8:30 p.m. now and I can’t see any food in it. They will have consumed over one half gallon of sugar water today.

Charlie, the neighbor’s bear dog, is still with me. I get to keep her until the weather clears and the neighbors can get back down here. Thanks to Charlie’s being on guard she alerted me to a moose just across the river this morning. We watched her for a while till she crossed to our side and disappeared into the brush.

MAY 13th

About 12:30 this morning Charlie started having a fit. I grabbed a flashlight and let her out. She kept running around the outside of the cabin. The little LED flashlight didn’t help much in finding out what was out there. About a half hour later she was still very agitated. When I called her she came in and we settled down for the rest of the night.

About 6:30 she started up again. I thought that is a lot of baking for the little weasel. Now Charlie was going under the cabin sounding more aggressive than ever. As I came back into the shop an Otter disappeared into a space along the wall. There turned out to be two otters.  Between Charlie and I giving them so much grief they have moved on to a quieter spot.

Good progress was made on cleaning up the accumulated stuff today. It rained on and off most of the day. Tomorrow if the weather cooperates I might start preparing to install the woodstove. I’m almost out of heating oil.

MAY 14th

Charlie got the morning off to good start for herself. She caught a sea gull out in front.

I did get started on preparing for the wood stove. The cabin has a plywood floor. Some time back the previous owner bought some laminate flooring but didn’t get a chance to install it. I got about half the floor done today. It didn’t go down nearly as easily as the last time I worked with that kind of flooring. Maybe sitting around in high humidity for several years had something to do with it. Anyway, now that the floor is finished under where the wood stove will be I can proceed to figure out to protect the floor and wall from the heat it will put out. I’m fairly motivated in that I am out of heating oil.

It was another rainy day. Fog came and went through the day. No small planes were flying. Because I am so near the ocean the temperatures stay very even. On a cloudy day like today the low might be 42 and the high for the day 48. All I have to do to stay warm is stay busy. Otherwise it requires several layers.

Since I have no radio and no internet I don’t know what the forecast is. Sometimes my little weather station shows the pressure going up. That means fair weather ahead. Then it changes its mind.

MAY 15th

The friends who are also neighbors arrived today. Three trips in the plane from Yakutat to get their cabins stocked for the season. Dinner with them this evening featured Beer Batter halibut for an appetizer. Meatloaf and red potatoes, fresh salad. All this was accompanied by great conversation and Buffalo Trace bourbon. It was a great meal.

I got the internet working late this morning. Now I can begin to learn how post pictures on this site so they are not upside down.

We got the outside chimney installed for the wood stove. I should have heat in the cabin tomorrow before noon.",MAY 15th,,inherit,open,open,,82-revision-v1,,,2013-05-21 07:07:15,2013-05-21 15:07:15,,82,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/05/21/82-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0
622,3,2013-05-19 22:47:28,2013-05-20 06:47:28,"Bright sun this morning shinning down on an inch of new snow. By afternoon it was short shirt sleeve weather. All the snow was gone as soon as the sun hit it.

A bear was just across the river early today. It was just ambling along trying to find something to eat among the sea oats.  The otter has moved up the creek.  It was under Lisa's house this morning.  The weasel is back with me.  I have a trap set.

As the weather improved, and at low tide, I waded across the river and walked up the beach for a couple of miles. On the way back I found another glass float. A very small one this time.

I think I mentioned the hundreds of gulls that are feeding on something in the river. They seem to be catching a small slender fish similar to a grunion (large minnow in size). These little fish come in to spawn in the sand. There are literally millions of them. After they spawn they die and wash up all along the beach. There were so many a few days ago neighbors flying in could see the lines of them washed ashore. They provide a real feast for some of the wildlife.

Tonight I was invited to dinner at Pat and Lisa's cabin. Steak, potatoes broccoli, and a wonderful slaw. Everyone in this part of the preserve was there. All ten of us.

Tomorrow I have to make an unplanned trip to Anchorage to find a dentist. I broke a tooth and it is requesting attention. While there I will do some shopping for cabin maintenance stuff.

623,3,2013-10-21 12:12:41,2013-10-21 20:12:41,"A very beautiful day in Alaska. There are two jet flights into Yakutat each day. The morning, northbound, flight originates in Seattle, stops in Juneau, Yakutat, Cordova and ends in Anchorage. That same plane turns around, southbound, and makes those same stops on the way back to Seattle. I had a very busy morning getting a lot of shopping done for the cabin and caught the southbound back to Yakutat.

It was clear all the way from Anchorage. I sat on the left side of the plane so I could see the continuous mountain ranges below. They all still have snow on them down to about 1,000 feet. As these warm days come more often one can see the snow line rise up the mountains each day. Between Anchorage and the cabin there must be at least 50 coastal glaciers. The rivers that flow from them to the sea are all a light gray color from the silt created by the glacier as it grinds across the stones. Those rivers all have icebergs in them. Some the size of garbage cans. Some appear to be as big as city blocks. The ice sheet at the head of some of these glaciers is the largest in North America. To see all that white snow and ice then land at the cabin which sits in a temperate rain forest....we live on an amazing planet.

Neighbor, Harold met me at the airport and we flew on down to the cabin in his plane. The ghost of my extracted tooth was haunting me so I took some medicine to chase it away. The weasel was here and greeted me with some news. There is clear plastic stapled to the ceiling joists that holds the insulation up. I could see the weasel moving around on top of the clear plastic but below the insulation. As I watched I noticed some more movement above the plastic.
She had a litter of little weasels up there. Harold's grandson and his girlfriend came over to see the litter. Harold's son, Pat, wanted me to catch the weasels and put them in another neighbor's house. I decided not to do that.

We positioned a deep Rubbermaid tub under the nest and cut the plastic around the nest. The seven little weasels and the mother weasel all fell into the tub. We took them about a hundred yards from the cabin and turned the tub on its side. Out pops mom with a little weasel in her mouth. She ran into the woods with it. We left her alone and in maybe 15 minutes she had moved all seven of her pups(?) to some other place.

For a newbe like me trying to understand webbing, fathoms and mesh depth which can all vary depending on the water you are fishing and the targeted fish. I have thought enough about it today.

Later we took my boat over to the Alsek river (a huge fast river). On the way one of those wheels fell off. We got it back on without a lot of trouble. As I approached the cabin coming back the two bears were on my side of the river. Charlie, the neighbor's bear dog spotted them. Charlie weighs maybe 50 pounds. She went tearing out after these two grizzly bears. At first they just watch her barreling toward themselves. Then they seem to think, ""who is that little thing kidding""? But she is coming at them so fast and seems so determined the two bears turn tail and run right into and across the river. Charlie came back looking very proud of herself.

All ready to go fishing tomorrow.  Those two totes behind the four wheeler contain two  20 fathom nets, anchors and buoys.  The white box on the front tote is to put in the boat. If I catch any fish they will go in there instead of sliding around on the bottom of the boat.

Last evening. I was sitting inside the bigger window and saw something brown move right under the window. It took up a lot of space on the ground. First thought was bear. It turned out to be a swarm of otters. I couldn't get a good count cause they were moving so quickly. I know there were five and maybe seven. As I watched they all went under the cabin. I proceeded to make much stomping noise on the floor. I didn't see them leave but they have because I didn't hear or see them at all later. If they had settled in under there I was going borrow Charlie to go under there after them.

This morning one of the world's great travelers stopped for a visit. An American Golden Plover was on the front yard. The breeding habitat of American Golden Plover is Arctic tundra from northern Canada and Alaska. They nest on the ground in a dry open area. They are migratory and winter in southern South America. They follow an elliptical migration path; northbound birds pass through Central America about January–April. In fall, they take a more easterly route, flying mostly over the western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea to the wintering grounds in Patagonia. The bird has one of the longest known migratory routes of over 25,000 miles. Of this, 2,400 miles is over open ocean where it cannot stop to feed or drink. It does this from body fat stores that it stocks up on prior to the flight. Most of this paragraph I pulled off the Internet.

There is so much nature here. As I took the picture above there were six Bald Eagles having a discussion across the creek behind me.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">That is what a 32 pound King Salmon looks like.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Well opening day for commercial fishing on the Alsek river went pretty well.  The regulations permit one to start fishing at 12:01 p.m. on Sunday and you had to stop fishing with nets out of the water by 12:00 today.  That's the way it is every week while that river is open to fishing.  Each morning after an opening there is an announcement made at 9:00 informing fishermen if fishing will be allowed that day.  Sometimes you can fish for several days in a row.  That is seldom the case for the first week's opening.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">""The <b>Alsek River</b> is a <a title=""Wilderness"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness"">wilderness</a> <a title=""River"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"">river</a> flowing from <a title=""Yukon"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon"">Yukon</a> into Northern <a title=""British Columbia"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"">British Columbia</a> and into <a title=""Alaska"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"">Alaska</a>. The surrounding area from the Western edge of the Alsek to East of the East Alsek is known to locals as Dry Bay.  The Alsek and East Alsek rivers are a part of the Yakutat area limited entry set gillnet fishery. Both rivers produce <a title=""Chinook salmon"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_salmon"">King</a>, <a title=""Coho salmon"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coho_salmon"">Silver</a>, and <a title=""Sockeye salmon"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockeye_salmon"">Sockeye</a> commercially. <a title=""Chum salmon"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chum_salmon"">Chum</a> and <a title=""Pink salmon"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_salmon"">Pink salmon</a> can also be caught, but are not generally sought after due to their relative lack of worth/quality. These two rivers can be characterized as low volume fisheries, while the Alsek river in particular produces particularly high quality salmon due to its low temperature. The Alsek's silt content also prevents the sun from damaging the fish.""  I did a little more research on the Alsek.  This afternoon its flow volume was 45,800 cubic feet of water per second.  For comparison at the same time the flow of the Colorado river at Durango was 1,300 CFS.  The Alsek is a BIG river.  Where we were fishing was in some sheltered water right at the mouth.  I could hear the surf in the Pacific as I sat in the boar waiting for a fish to hit the net.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yesterday we dropped the nets in the water shortly after noon.  We stayed on the river till after eight last night.  This morning we left before 5:00 to resume fishing.  I was able to catch 4 sockeye yesterday and today brought in that fish I'm holding above as well as another King and a couple more sockeye.  My neighbors have a company that sells these fish directly to restaurants as far away as Newark, NJ.  That fish I caught this morning may well be in Newark Wednesday night.  I sell them the fish at the going rate right off my boat.  Then they clean them and pack them in Ice.  An air service will pick the packed fish up and take them to Yakutat.  There they are loaded onto one of the two jets that come through everyday, end up in Seattle where they are air freighted on to the restaurant.  Next Sunday we do it all again.  I expect in the next week of so there will be more days of fishing after each opening.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A cousin asked what happens to the parts of the fish that we don't keep?  Where my buyer cleans the fish is about a mile from the Pacific.  Today I took all the heads, guts etc. over to the beach and spread them out at the edge of the surf.  In less than 30 seconds after I pulled away ravens were there grabbing morsels.  In less than 90 seconds the first 4 Bald Eagles showed up.  After 5 minutes there must have been a dozen eagles swooping in to grab something.  Many of them would land but some of them would just glide in real low, grab something and fly off with it.  Another fisherman told me the eagles soon learn to associate the 4 wheeler on the beach at that spot with food.  When they learn that you can look up and down the coast and see eagles coming in from as far as you can see.</p>

A 1x6 you buy at a lumberyard is actually .75 inches by 5.5 inches.

It's about six miles across Dry Bay to where we unloaded the boats. The boats are used to ferry the lumber from the other side of the Alsek river. that is where the better logs are. We use the same trailers shown in an earlier post without the fish totes on them. There is a maze of roads across Dry Bay. I made three trips across and used three different routes.

What about the bear coming back two times that night looking for more and eating part of the 4 wheeler seat. What about being positionally challenged on the Alsek river at 11:00 at night or the cross country walk that got me to the cabin after midnight, then getting up at 4:30 to go check the nets again. Maybe it should be about pulling 17 sockeye keepers out of my net in one pass. I could finish up by describing how I am determined to learn more about all the things my GPS can do for me.

This was the second day the set gillnet fishing season has been open for the Alsek River this year. I fish two nets. I try and position them to catch the sockeye salmon heading upstream to spawn. There are also king Salmon on the river now and we catch a few of them along with the sockeye.

&nbsp;

The picture is the view I have while watching the net. That big mountain is Mount Fairweather. Canada is on the left side of the mountain's peak. Mount Fairweather is over 15,000 feet tall.

The process of getting the fish from the river to your local fish market is not a long one but because the product is so fragile pretty complicated.

I sell the fish to Alsek Fish. They are a small speciality supplier to markets and fine resturants across the lower 48 states. I deliver the fish hole and am paid by the pound. Different fish bring different prices. Alsek Fish cleans the fish, packs them in ice and air freights the fish to its final destination. Simple right? Noooooo. To get the fish from the river to the air freight office requires a chartered bush plane to fly them there after landing on the beach. The fish are packed in ice. That requires an ice making machine that depends on a generator for power. The bush plane has a charter fee. The fish are packed in special waxed cardboard boxes. Specific labels are required on each box of fish shipped. Alaska fish and game requires certain paperwork indicating where the fish were caught and by whom. In all this process I feel very lucky to be in on the fun part. Just catching the fish.

What about the bear coming back two times that night looking for more and eating part of the 4 wheeler seat. What about being positionally challenged on the Alsek river at 11:00 at night or the cross country walk that got me to the cabin after midnight, then getting up at 4:30 to go check the nets again. Maybe it should be about pulling 17 sockeye keepers out of my net in one pass. I could finish up by describing how I am determined to learn more about all the things my GPS can do for me.

This was the second day the set gillnet fishing season has been open for the Alsek River this year. I fish two nets. I try and position them to catch the sockeye salmon heading upstream to spawn. There are also king Salmon on the river now and we catch a few of them along with the sockeye.

The picture is the view I have while watching the net. That big mountain is Mount Fairweather. Canada is on the left side of the mountain's peak. Mount Fairweather is over 15,000 feet tall.

The process of getting the fish from the river to your local fish market is not a long one but because the product is so fragile pretty complicated.

I sell the fish to Alsek Fish. They are a small speciality supplier to markets and fine resturants across the lower 48 states. I deliver the fish hole and am paid by the pound. Different fish bring different prices. Alsek Fish cleans the fish, packs them in ice and air freights the fish to its final destination. Simple right? Noooooo. To get the fish from the river to the air freight office requires a chartered bush plane to fly them there after landing on the beach. The fish are packed in ice. That requires an ice making machine that depends on a generator for power. The bush plane has a charter fee. The fish are packed in special waxed cardboard boxes. Specific labels are required on each box of fish shipped. Alaska fish and game requires certain paperwork indicating where the fish were caught and by whom. In all this process I feel very lucky to be in on the fun part. Just catching the fish.

He showed me some places to set my nets on this side of the Alsek. Then we took his boat way up the river. In some places we could see very troubled water. Big swirls and whorl pools. The current was very fast. He had a depth finder on his boat. The water was 40 to 70 feet deep along there. A couple of weeks ago I reported here that the Colorado River was flowing at 1,300 cubic feet per second. The Colorado is a big river in that part of the country. A while back the Alsek was flowing at over 150,000 CFM according to my friend. It is a very big river.

On the boat tour this morning he told me about the wolf that would walk along the bank where ha fished nearly every day one season. Today he pointed out a couple of Bald Eagle nests in trees right at the edge of the river.

After dinner we enjoyed listening to tale after tale about life up here. My guest is interested in studying otters. Since there are no more otters under my cabin he was told of another unused cabin near by where a group of otters reside. I wouldn't be surprised if those otters have a visitor from Boulder soon.

The surf was really pounding. It reminded me of the sounds a freight train makes when it has been stopped and then starts up again. As the couplings between the cars engage each other you can hear each car pick up the load of the following car. That clunk you hear that travels down the line of cars noise. Last night the waves coming ashore were sounding like that. Yesterday a guest at the neighbor’s house found a couple of glass fishing floats. One of them was 12 inches in diameter. Most of them are about 4 inches across. With all the wave action last night I thought there might be some good beachcombing this morning. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky early so by six thirty I was out the door. The power of all this water never ceases to amaze me. Today there were chunks of ice on the beach that had washed out into the ocean from the river, then back onto the beach some distance from the river’s mouth. One chunk was about half the size of my 4 wheeler. I did find three glass floats. Icouple of years ago I asked how you can tell if there are King Salmon in the river? I was told to look into the water and look for small logs. Those might be Kings.

I don’t know how long it took to land that fish. I had hooked a couple of others earlier and managed to land one of them. This fish felt different. To keep it from taking all the line off my reel I had to follow it down the river. I ended up a couple of hundred yards downstream from where I started. When I got back home the eagle was sitting in the tree in front of the house. I hope it keeps perching there.

Today we were supposed to fly out to the cabin. The plan was to be at the Juneau airport early and pack the single engine plane with two SUV loads of provisions. We would then fly northwest for an hour, land on the beach, taxi up to the cabin and unload all the stuff we had been accumulating over the past several weeks....no, make that months.

Well...Mother Nature has gotten involved in our best laid plans. She has decided to rain and snow and blow so that small planes can't fly. They may not fly for several days.

Two days ago the weather was beautiful. Nature is so close all around up here. Yesterday We saw 12 Bald Eagles sitting in the same tree. The Mendenhall glacier is just four miles up the road. The air is so fresh here it seems the source of it must be very near by.

This is the first ""official"" note I have entered in this electronic journal. I'll add to it from time to time.

I seem to be falling into a routine.  I get up in the mornings with a pretty full to do list in my mind.  After breakfast I seem to have trouble deciding which task to start on first.  Unable to decide on a task I just go play.  Today I drove down the beach to the mouth of the Alsek river to look for glass floats.  The Alsek is a glacier fed river.  The water is a light gray from all the silt the glacier creates.  Today there were several pieces of ice that had floated all the way from the glacier to the mouth of the river.  One of them was half the size of the four wheeler.  My neighbor collects some of the ice from the river to keep her food cold in coolers.  I found a rare amber colored glass float.  A Google search says the amber color is rare and the glass probably started out as a beer bottle.

On the way back I saw something else unusual.  There was a beaver in the edge of the surf.  I thought beavers were strictly fresh water critters.  There wasn't a tree for this guy to chew on in sight.

While typing this there is a bear across the creek in front of the cabin.  It is going the other way.  That is probably good.

A couple of days ago I mentioned doing some laundry.  My neighbor's adult kids spend part of the fishing season on a very remote river.  To do their laundry they clean out the totes they usually haul fish in.  Then they pour several gallons of fresh water into the tote.  Add a little detergent, add the clothes then just drive around on the four wheeler pulling the tote.  The agitation caused by bumping along the riverbank gets the clothes ""cleaner""!

The second wall is framed and lying on the floor, ready to raise tomorrow morning. With any luck we will get the other two walls up tomorrow.

We were invited to dinner at the parents of the new cabin owners place tonight. Fresh King Salmon poached in foil with the perfect spices. Green beans and rice. The correct libations were available too.

Another neighbor and his mother joined us. Mrs. M is 91 years old. She spends most of her summer up here. She will ride from place to place on the back of a four wheeler. Crossing the Alsek river in an open boat to hop on another four wheeler seems to suit her just fine.

After dinner we enjoyed listening to tale after tale about life up here. My guest is interested in studying otters. Since there are no more otters under my cabin he was told of another unused cabin near by where a group of otters reside. I wouldn't be surprised if those otters have a visitor from Boulder soon.

We didn't see it but as a plane landed in front of the cabin a bear ran off the runway into the brush across the creek. After all the noise we made pounding nails all day I wonder if the bear had come out of the bushes to see what was going on?",JUNE 18th,,inherit,open,open,,195-revision-v1,,,2013-10-22 08:02:33,2013-10-22 16:02:33,,195,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/10/22/195-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

Some of the wildflowers are beginning to fade but others are just beginning to come out. The white lupines are not uncommon but compared to the blue ones they are a very small percentage of the total. In other words the blue lupines are everywhere. Acres and acres of them. The little shooting stars are past their prime but there are some places where their dark pink hue carpets the ground. Wild strawberries are blooming in every spot they can get a glimpse of the sky. The yellow Indian paintbrush have just come out and the side yard will be covered with daisies next week.

There were at least 4 happy people at Dry Bay today. The young couple whose cabin I have been helping to build got to stand on their new second floor this afternoon. For me it was a special moment to see them up there experiencing the view for the first time from what will be their bedroom. I know it was a special moment for them too. They stood there, arms around each other feeling one of their dreams come true.

Another happy person was my neighbor who is visiting. He caught his first Salmon with a rod and reel this evening. I don't know exactly what he was doing that I wasn't but he hooked twelve fish in his opinion, landed the one. I hooked the same log on the bottom of the river twice and that was it for me. I am supposed to guide some other fishermen later this summer. I guess if they catch all the fish they might think I'm a pretty good guide. If they expect me to show them how to catch the fish I may not last long as a guide

The other pleased person here today was me. We got most of the remaining accumulated junk into a big pile and burnt it up. It is almost eleven as I type this and the stuff is still smoldering. By clearing out around the cabin I found a kayak buried under some of the unwanted stuff. It looks like it will float but I'm going to wait for the water to warm up some more before I try it out.

For me it was a special moment to see them up there experiencing the view for the first time from what will be their bedroom. I know it was a special moment for them too. They stood there, arms around each other feeling one of their dreams come true.

Another happy person was my neighbor who is visiting. He caught his first Salmon with a rod and reel this evening. I don't know exactly what he was doing that I wasn't but he hooked twelve fish in his opinion, landed the one. I hooked the same log on the bottom of the river twice and that was it for me. I am supposed to guide some other fishermen later this summer. I guess if they catch all the fish they might think I'm a pretty good guide. If they expect me to show them how to catch the fish I may not last long as a guide

The other pleased person here today was me. We got most of the remaining accumulated junk into a big pile and burnt it up. It is almost eleven as I type this and the stuff is still smoldering. By clearing out around the cabin I found a kayak buried under some of the unwanted stuff. It looks like it will float but I'm going to wait for the water to warm up some more before I try it out.

Some of the wildflowers are beginning to fade but others are just beginning to come out. The white lupines are not uncommon but compared to the blue ones they are a very small percentage of the total. In other words the blue lupines are everywhere. Acres and acres of them. The little shooting stars are past their prime but there are some places where their dark pink hue carpets the ground. Wild strawberries are blooming in every spot they can get a glimpse of the sky.

661,3,2013-10-22 08:06:43,2013-10-22 16:06:43,"Last evening I was too tired to post anything here. The commercial fishing opened up again at noon Sunday. The Alsek river is running very high due to the extremely long spell of dry, sunny weather. The snow in the mountains is melting faster than normal. That water accelerates the glacier's melting so many icebergs are coming down the river. Add to all that the super moon caused the highest tide swing (15 feet from high tide to the next low tide) since I have been here.

All that water caused havoc with the fishing. The spots that usually hold fish don't. Trees floating down the river tear out the nets. A lot of limbs and twigs get caught in the nets causing the fish to avoid getting caught. I caught a dozen sockeye. Two of them were damaged in the net by seals. The buyer couldn't use them so I brought them home to eat.

The last three nights my neighbor Rick or I have cleaned a salmon down at the creek in front of the cabin. A bald eagle sits down there waiting for us to toss a scrap into the water or up on the bank of the stream. As soon as we do the eagles pumps its wings a couple of times and glides over and snatches the morsel. It must have a nest near buy. It flies off in the same direction every time. In about one minute it returns looking for more. If there is another scrap nearby the bird has already seen it and is gliding straight toward it...ignoring me. The eagle swooshes right over my head, not ten feet off the ground. Even with my poor hearing I can hear the air passing over its wings as it goes by. By now other eagles have seen the commotion and have begun to gather. Also by now the scraps provided buy one salmon are nearly gone. It is a sight to see, these magnificent wild birds so close.

Like the wire that serves as my clothesline. It was too short to reach the tree and even if it did it would sag. So I used one of those ratchet straps we use to tie things down on the trailer. It served as an extension to the wire so I could reach the tree and gave me a way to pull the wire tight.

On the other hand I wrote recently about how much water I have to pump by hand to fill the washing machine. I think I wrote it took over 1,400 strokes at the hand pump to supply enough water to do three loads. Why am I pumping water with a hand pump when there is a creek running outside the door with pure, clear, clean, soft water running in it. I could take a trailer and tote down there, fill it with water, and bring it back to the cabin in less time than it has taken to type this paragraph. I think I won't mind doing laundry as much next time.",JUNE 24th,,inherit,open,open,,211-revision-v1,,,2013-10-22 08:06:43,2013-10-22 16:06:43,,211,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/10/22/211-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

One of the neighbors said I should go over and check on my boat. I hadn't been over to where it is anchored for nearly a week. Wen I got there it was pretty low in the water. I probably bailed out more than 50 gallons. She's riding high again. While I was tending to her I thought I'd start the outboard motor just to warm it up. That engine is very hard to start when it is cold. I'm about to spring for a new outboard, one with a battery to start it.

The yard around the cabin is in full bloom right now. Tonight I asked v Rick if he would walk around outside and identify the various flowers that are blooming right now.

Article Lupine, Yellow Indian Paintbrush, Western Columbine, Shooting Star, Chocolate Lily, Western Yarrow in a couple of colors, Daisy, Wild Strawberries, Cow Parsnip, Beach Peas, Wild Chives, Cinquisoil, Wild Iris, Dandelion, Pink Plumes, Wild Celery and Cloud Berry. Several of you know without my Colorado neighbor Rick there is no way I could have identified all those different flowering plants. That list doesn't even include the many varieties of grass out there in the yard.

As we walked around outside, Charlie the neighbor's bear dog came over to see what we were doing. Since we were walking around and not climbing up on one of the Hondas she must have figured we were hunting something. If Charlie knew we were just hunting plants I bet she would have stayed home.

A real treat showed up a couple of weeks ago. It is a hummingbird I had never seen before. He drops by every few minutes. He is an Anna's hummingbird. The top of his head is red as well as his throat. I'm going to pull in some interesting information from the Internet about this beautiful bird.

Anna's Hummingbird (Calypte anna) is a medium-sized hummingbird native to the west coast of North America. This bird was named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-272"" alt=""image"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image3.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></a>

Anna's Hummingbird is 3.9 to 4.3 inches (10 to 11 centimeters) long. It has a bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. Its bill is long, straight and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red crown and throat, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Anna's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown.
These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small insects caught in flight. A PBS documentary that first aired January 10, 2010, shows how Anna's Hummingbirds eat flying insects. They aim for the flying insect, then open their beaks very wide. That technique has a greater success rate than trying to aim the end of a long beak at the insect.

Unlike most hummingbirds, the male Anna's Hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing a remarkable display, called a display dive, on their territories. The males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species. When a female flies onto a male's territory, he rises up approximately 30 metres (98 ft) before diving over the recipient. As he approaches the bottom of the dive the males reach an average speed which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive the male travels 23 metres per second (51 mph), and produces a loud sound described by some as an ""explosive squeak"" with his outer tail-feathers.

Anna's Hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America, from southern Canada to northern Baja California, and inland to southern Arizona. They tend to be permanent residents within their range, and are very territorial. However, birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana and Newfoundland.

Anna's hummingbirds are the only hummingbirds to spend the winter in northern climates; they are able to do this as there are enough winter flowers and food to support them. During cold temperatures, Anna's Hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat. In addition, hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of sub-freezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor.

The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red crown and throat, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Anna's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown.
These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small insects caught in flight. A PBS documentary that first aired January 10, 2010, shows how Anna's Hummingbirds eat flying insects. They aim for the flying insect, then open their beaks very wide. That technique has a greater success rate than trying to aim the end of a long beak at the insect.

Unlike most hummingbirds, the male Anna's Hummingbird sings during courtship. The song is thin and squeaky. During the breeding season, males can be observed performing a remarkable display, called a display dive, on their territories. The males also use the dive display to drive away rivals or intruders of other species. When a female flies onto a male's territory, he rises up approximately 30 metres (98 ft) before diving over the recipient. As he approaches the bottom of the dive the males reach an average speed which is 385 body lengths per second. At the bottom of the dive the male travels 23 metres per second (51 mph), and produces a loud sound described by some as an ""explosive squeak"" with his outer tail-feathers.

Anna's Hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America, from southern Canada to northern Baja California, and inland to southern Arizona. They tend to be permanent residents within their range, and are very territorial. However, birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska, Saskatchewan, New York, Florida, Louisiana and Newfoundland.

Anna's hummingbirds are the only hummingbirds to spend the winter in northern climates; they are able to do this as there are enough winter flowers and food to support them. During cold temperatures, Anna's Hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat. In addition, hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of sub-freezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor.

I'll be commercial fishing tomorrow and maybe Monday. Wish me luck.

That new roof on the cabin next door is the reason I didn't post anything here yesterday.  I was one tired old guy.  Two of us were on the roof nailing down the sheathing while we kept a whole crew of people on the ground sending up more material.  Well, it wasn't a very big crew on the ground but I know some of them will read this and may want to debate who was keeping who busy.

This morning I went down to the mouth of the Alsek River to get some ice for the cooler.  When I got back I took the fly rod out to play.  It caught a nice sockeye salmon.  This afternoon the neighbors saw the wolf mentioned a couple of days back.  This time there were two others with it.  I wish I could have seen the trio, one black, one gray, and a white one.

As you can see some very large chunks come down from the glacier.  The pieces in the photo would have been many times larger before they floated down.

I frequently mention the mouth of that big river and all that goes on there with the battle between the river's current and the tides.  The wall of sand, in the picture below, is constantly changing.  Over the decades all sorts of stuff has been buried in those sand dunes.  As the battle between the river and ocean keep occurring, twice a day, that buried material washes out.  I have watched logs 20 feet long appear out of the dune then in a few days be gone as the sand that had them buried is washed away and the log is once again floating somewhere else.

669,3,2013-07-15 22:10:18,2013-07-16 06:10:18,"I believe it was last night after I finished here the black wolf appeared and was hunting along the other side of the river. He was catching mice or voles in the tall grass. it would stand very still then jump into the air and I suppose come down on what ever was being hunted. As I watched with binoculars, I noticed a large bear feeding just a little farther back off the river. That scene was pure wilderness.

This morning I saw five bears before breakfast. Two sows with three cubs.

Later, motoring down the beach for some ice for the cooler I came across a family group of Brant Geese.

These small geese (up to about 5 pounds) have very short bills. The group I was approaching were right at the edge of the surf. As I was about to pass them they took flight. I didn't think anything of that since all the birds you zoom by take off. I looked toward the surf a few seconds later and those geese were flying along beside me. When I sped up they kept up. If I slowed down they did too, even to the point where they would drop their feet preparing to land. I sped up again, they picked up their feet and kept up. Finally I just stopped about 50 feet from the surf's edge. The geese landed between me and the ocean. It was amazing. The following is from the internet:

""It used to be a strictly coastal bird in winter, seldom leaving tidal estuaries, where it feeds on eel-grass and the seaweed. In recent decades, it has started using agricultural land a short distance inland, feeding extensively on grass and winter-sown cereals. This may be behaviour learnt by following other species of geese. Food resource pressure may also be important in forcing this change, as the world population has risen over tenfold to 400,000-500,000, possibly reaching the carrying capacity of the estuaries. In the breeding season, it uses low-lying wet coastal tundra for both breeding and feeding. The nest is bowl-shaped, lined with grass and down, in an elevated location, often in a small pond.""

Tomorrow my son and the new outboard arrive. I have to call the bush pilot in the morning. I am getting confusing and conflicting directions on where to meet the plane.

My goal today was to get the new well in so I can plumb the cabin for running water.  The well is really just a pipe driven into the ground,  the bottom section of the pipe is called a sand point.  It is about four feet long and has many holes in it for the water to seep in.  On top of that there are three, three foot sections of pipe.  So all together there is a thirteen foot piece of pipe that needs to be driven into the ground.  The neighbors let us borrow a tool they made to do the job.  It is a pipe about four feet long.  It is larger in diameter than the well pipe and had handles welded onto the sides.  The closed end of this tool has about sixty pounds of steel welded into it.  All together this pipe driver weighs about eighty pounds when you start using it.  By the time you lift this thing, slide it down over the well pipe, and then slam it down on the well pipe about three hundred times it weighs at least 150 pounds.  Thank heaven I had help.

That is the first glass of water from the new well.  The water is so cold condensation immediately appears on the glass.

Next we went over to the harbor to bring the boat to the cabin.  The East River may open to commercial fishing this week so I wanted the boat over here by the cabin.  When the dealer prepped the motor to be shipped on a plane he had to drain all the combustible fluids out of the engine.  When we installed the new motor on the boat and tested it I wasn't real happy with the low speed idle. N there was a little hose with a loose end inside the engine cover.  Gas would come out of this hose when the engine was running.  Another fisherman has the same outboard so we compared them. His engine had the little hose with the loose end in it also but it didn't leak gas....mystery!

On the way back across Dry Bay the road is sometimes bumpy.  At one especially bumpy spot I stopped to check to see if things were all right ini the boat.  John ini the meantime is yelling ""FIRE!!!!FIRE!!!"".  Smoke is coming out the bottom of the new outboard.  Remember the gas leak?  

Turns out the bump had capsized the battery.  It shorted out on the aluminum boat and caused a little ground wire on the engine to overheat and melt the insulation.  A little flame and a little more smoke but no big problem for the brand new , (did I mention expensive?) outboard.  The gas leaking out of the tube was because the dealer drained the gas from the engine but did not retighten the valve so whenever the engine was on it was squirting gas out the open valve.

After dinner (John ate some of the camper food my daughter sent and  I ate Grape Nuts) went fly fishing again.  John had caught and released four before I got my first one hooked.  While he was concentrating on one of his fish a bear had come out of the brush and approached the water's edge where he was fishing.  John said he was close enough that he could see the bear's eyes.  I bet the bear could see John's eyes too.  They were twice as big as normal.  Anyway all that sudden appearance of huge white eyes scared the bear away.

Walking back to the wheelers a bit more luck came his way.  The glasses he had lost in the water yesterday were there in the sand waiting for him.  It is amazing after two tide cycles that had not been swept away or buried in the sand.

It is going on eleven as I type this.  It has been such a wonderful day to spend with him I hate to see it end.

Walking back to the wheelers a bit more luck came his way. The glasses he had lost in the water yesterday were there in the sand waiting for him. It is amazing after two tide cycles that had not been swept away or buried in the sand.

It is going on eleven as I type this. It has been such a wonderful day to spend with him I hate to see it end.",JULY 20th,,inherit,open,open,,345-revision-v1,,,2013-10-22 08:20:28,2013-10-22 16:20:28,,345,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/10/22/345-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

The new fishing spot was a morale boost from the very beginning. The water is deep enough there to use the outboard with no problems.

We can drive the Hondas right up to where the net is set if we need to load or unload anything from the boat.

The Vet and I decided to fish the new spot I mentioned yesterday, last evening. I wanted to see what would happen to the net when the tide turned and the fish started coming in. I didn't have to wait that long. We started catching fish right away. As it got later we kept wondering why the current in the river hadn't changed as the tide came in. It turned out we had misread the tide table. So we continued catching a few fish. Then the tide did turn. The expected influx of fish did happen and we finally had our hands full, picking fish out of the net in the wee hours of today.

On the way over to deliver the fish to the buyer we had trouble with both trailers. One flat tire and one set of bad bearings. No real problem though. Two broken trailers can be made into one whole trailer that can carry the other broken trailer home.

In the two days of fishing we caught a little over two hundred fish. They averaged around six pounds each. That is a lot of sockeye. The experienced guys on the river caught their fair share more than we did. It was a pretty good opening. On Sunday the river will be open for fishing again. We will be out there too but probably not as late as this morning.

I did a little beach combing after checking the boat this evening. After a two week drought I found a couple of prizes tonight.

677,3,2013-08-26 23:22:09,2013-08-27 07:22:09,"A nice day mostly.  A little shower this afternoon while I was fishing, just enough to force the rain gear out of the tote on the back of the wheeler.

I thought the fishing would be especially good at first.  I caught two nice silvers in the first 15 minutes.  A half hour later, after changing flies, another couple of hits.  Kept changing flies and catching a couple then they would get lock jaw.  I threw a pink top water bug at them for a while.  It is really exciting to see a wave of water, like an underwater torpedo or miniature submarine, racing toward your fly.  Several did this afternoon but would turn away at the last second.  I guess they were not into pink today.

I did hook a world record silver though.  I'm sure it was the world record.  It was a very large fish.  It gave me the best fight of the day.  Long runs, taking lots of line off the reel.  A very bright and silvery fish.  He was so big when he would run toward me I was looking for a way to get out of his way.  Huge fish....He got away.  I did end up catching and releasing six or seven.

Back at the cabin I checked the river out front.  One of the neighbors from across Dry Bay has a sport fishing facility.  He has an arrangement with an outfitter in Canada (Canada is only about 40 miles away by air).  This Canadian outfitter has clients from all over Europe.  Today he had six guys from Germany fishing here.  You know it must be an expensive trip to come here from Europe.  Those men, I am sure, are used to life's finer things.  Here they are riding in a wooden trailer, open to the elements, being pulled by a Honda.  At least the trailer had springs so the ride couldn't have been too rough.

This morning we vacuumed the salmon that got smoked yesterday afternoon and evening.  The high tides and the erosion they cause called us back out onto the beach to beachcomb.  I don't know why that is so relaxing and if you find something interesting even more so.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/016.jpg""><img src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/016-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""016"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-499"" /></a>

Cheryl found this one and just a few yards from where I found one to.  When we got back to the cabin one of the neighbors came by.  He asked if we had heard the latest about Cheryl's flight out on Monday.  We had not.  Yesterday I sent a note to the bush pilot asking to reconfirm the time she would be picked up.  Turned out the office staff and the pilot were not on the same page.  The earliest they could pick her up was Wednesday afternoon.  

Having no sat phone, all I could do was email or use Skype to contact them.  After some juggling of things the office asked if we could be ready to go at 4:00 this afternoon.  To quote Cheryl, ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" we said we could be ready.  When asked where the pilot should meet us we checked the tide tables and discovered there was no way he could land in front of the cabin as hoped. (see the pic from yesterday)  There would be way too much water on the beach runway.  So that meant we needed to drive over to the fish plant across Dry Bay.  The high tide also meant we had to go the long way.  A forty minute ride.  It was already after two.  She got her stuff together and I packed the cooler with fish.  

Earlier I had sold the old outboard to a guy in Yakutat.  How to get it to him was a problem.  Since Cheryl was being picked up in a larger plane there was room for the outboard too.  There is no way I could lift a 75 hp outboard almost 5 feet into the air by myself.  I got on the VHF radio and in just a few minutes a couple of neighbors showed up.

By now it was raining steadily.  It was after three.  We had to take the long way to the plant to meet the pilot at four.  In case the plane was early, one neighbor blasted off to let the pilot know we were on the way.  The other neighbor followed behind Cheryl and me, watching to be sure nothing fell off the trailer I was pulling, with the outboard on it.  We got to the plant with a little time to spare.  Then we started waiting.  The clouds had gotten lower and it was raining harder by now.  Four thirty came and went.  We had no way to get in touch with anyone since the fish plant is closed for the season.  We heard a plane coming..it just flew on by.  We were wondering if the weather was so bad the pilot had turned back.  Do we keep waiting or go back home? Finally at nearly five we could tell from the sound our plane was coming in.

Some dear friends in Yakutat picked up Cheryl.  I thought they would just take her the short distance to the terminal and she would be on her way to Colorado.  Not to be.  It seems an Alaskan cruise ship has broken down south of here and some 3,100 people are trying to get home.  From the news I read some planes have been chartered to get those folks out.  As of this writing what I thought would be an easy ticket exchange might turn into an extended stay in Yakutat for Cheryl.

I will probably know something specific tomorrow.  We are fortunate the friends in Yakutat have a freezer. Sixty or seventy pounds of fish can't stay frozen on a cooler forever.

684,3,2013-10-22 08:27:23,2013-10-22 16:27:23,"MAY 15th. I have been keeping daily notes since May 4th but have not had internet access. Now that I do there are ten days of notes below. In the future there will not be nearly as much volume to read. Thanks for your interest.

MAY 4TH

Much has happened since I was able to add anything to this site. We were supposed to fly out to the cabin on May 1st. The weather was not cooperating so we stayed in Juneau another day. On the 2nd of May we were able to catch a flight to Gustavus and were treated to outstanding hospitality by our pilot and his wife. The clouds and fog were so dense visibility was near zero through a narrow pass called Icy Straights. The fog went all the way down to the surface of the sea….No place to be in a Cessna 206 single engine plane.

On Friday the 3rd. the weather forecast was very iffy. We were not sure when we might be able to get to the cabin. Considering that and a bunch of other details like, “once we get there will Cheryl be able to get out in time to make her connections back home” we decided she should just come on back home and I would make it out to the cabin whenever the weather would allow.

As nature would have it there was a break in weather and a narrow window opened and I got to the cabin about 3:00 Friday afternoon. It was raining. The weather service predicted 100% chance of rain, heavy at times. They were right. It rained, heavy at times, non-stop until 3:00 Saturday afternoon.

I have been spending much of my time just watching the spectacle in front of the cabin. As I type this there are three flocks of migrating birds in my front yard. There are nearly 100 Canada geese just to the left. Directly in front of me there is a flock of 37 Sandhill cranes and a little beyond them must be 50 Snow geese. Throughout the day I have watched this spectacle. Frequently I see a few Greater White-fronted geese mixed in with the others.

&nbsp;

Bald Eagles appear fairly often. You can tell when one is approaching. All the birds feeding take to the air in one huge mass. As soon as the eagle has passed they all come back and resume feeding…right in my front yard.

I’m loving it.

MAY 5TH
Today would have been Mother’s birthday. She wouldn’t have liked it here but would have been happy that I’m able to enjoy all this nature.

It has stopped raining and the clouds are a little higher today. Late in the afternoon I did hear a small plane fly by. That means the weather must be moderating some.

Made good progress getting the outside cleaned up today. Over the years an assortment of plastic and fiberglass articles had accumulated. There were a few alder bushes that were blocking some of the view out the front. I had a heck of a bon fire going for a while. Some of that stuff made really dense black smoke.

Not such a variety of waterfowl out front today. There was a large flock of Canada geese out front late. I’m guessing 250 birds. They graze back and forth less than 100 feet from the front door.

As far as I can tell there is no one else here in the preserve. I check a neighboring cabin to see if their internet connection was working….it wasn’t.

MAY 6TH

Coolest morning yet. Thirty six outside. Forty seven inside. The stove works well and before long I’ll have it up in the middle 60s. There is some blue in the sky and I can see the mountains off in the east. There is beginning to be a tinge of green on the ground and the alders have little buds showing.

Decided to go down to the mouth of the Alsek River to look for glass floats. These baseball size glass balls used to be used to float the fishing nets used by the Japanese fishing off shore. I found a few.

On the way down the beech I saw my first bear of the season. At the mouth of the river a group of sea lions had gathered. The herd bull would frequently bellow or roar his presence. There seemed to be many young seals there too.

MAY 7TH

A beautiful blue sky morning with no wind. The heavy frost is quickly disappearing in the warm sunshine. Not many birds on the ground out front. It is unusual to look up into the sky and not see flocks of birds all heading the same way… North. As I type this an Osprey landed out front. The first humming bird just flew by. Got to get a feeder for them! Those sea lions mentioned yesterday…They are several miles away and I can hear them roaring here at the cabin.

Borrowed a neighbor’s hummingbird feeder. They are not here yet so I didn’t think they would mind. I put the feeder up about ten this morning. By noon several pairs had found it. All the hummers I have seen up here are the Rufous hummingbirds. We see them passing through Colorado in July.

I met another resident yesterday. I spent most of the day working on the storage area of the cabin. Hearing a little noise I discovered an Ermine (weasel) watching me. I hope she appreciates the redecorating.

Also discovered the freezer freezes and the washing machine washes.

MAY 8th
A little chilly this morning, 30 outside and 40 inside. Another beautiful morning. I was up around 4:15. The hummingbirds were already buzzing around outside wondering where their feeder was!

My neighbor flew down from Yakutat. He brought all the stuff I need to get the internet connection set up. He also brought provisions to begin stocking their cabin. He flew back to town and will return tomorrow with more supplies for his cabin. He will also bring the things to install the wood stove. I have been heating with an oil stove. With an endless supply of free fuel outside it seems silly to buy oil then have to fly it in.

While we were standing outside another resident came up from out of the woods. It was a fair size brown bear (grizzly). He went back into the brush before I could get some good close-up pictures.

MAY 9th

High human traffic today. The neighbor flew back in with a friend of his. He brought all the parts needed to install the wood stove. Now I have to decide if I want to use the old wood stove that was stored here or get a new one. It’s not only the cost of the stove but getting it here will be expensive too. A pilot we flew with last year stopped by. He had been delivering fuel to a bear hunter’s camp. He was flying a neat little “cub” that had skis attached just above the wheels. He could land on the beach or in the snow. A little later two of the guides from the bear hunter camp stopped. Whew! I didn’t get as much work done as I hoped.

Did get the attic emptied out. There was some high quality outdoor gear up there.

A couple of wildlife things. The hummers are drinking over a quart of food a day. The weasel was back in the cabin last night. I nearly swatted him with my cap as it scurried across the floor.

MAY 10th

Last night I installed new gaskets in the hand pump by the sink. Whenever I needed more water I had to pump that handle at least 50 times (I actually counted). This morning on the 7th stroke water appeared. That is so neat. To not have to work up a sweat to get a cup of water.

My neighbor has a portable saw mill. It comes in heal handy when you need more than a couple of boards that could be flown in on a small plane. Yesterday he found a fir log down on the beach over 40 feet long. Today we went down there, cut the log into 2 twenty footers rolled them onto an ingenious trailer and brought that huge log home to be sawed up into boards.

This afternoon we got all the internet hardware mounted on the house and the wiring done. I still don’t have a connection to the internet. We think it is because there are some trees blocking the clear view of the sky the satellite dish needs. So tomorrow I’ll be turning trees into firewood.

MAY 11th
I went down to the mouth of the Alsek this morning to do a little more beachcombing. Found one glass float that had appeared with the tide. A little later my neighbor stopped in. He had also gone down there. He found another glass float not twenty feet from where I found mine. I expect I was so pleased to find one I didn’t bother to look around for another so close.

The alder trees grow so quickly here they encroach on any clear space. So over the years they had invaded the space around the cabin clearing. I had been trimming them back for several days. Yesterday I spent quite a while burning them.

Nearby, the little weasel was very busy hunting for something.

My neighbor and his friend flew back to Yakutat around noon. He left the dog, Charlie, with me for the night. There had been a very light rain falling most of the day. When I went to bed it was pitch black inside. A little while later I could sense something very close. I turned on the light and Charlie was staring at me from a few inches away. Needless to say she wanted to be up off the floor. As far as I know she didn’t move all night….a good bed mate.

MAY 12th

I woke up this morning feeling an empty place. This is the first Mother’s Day in all these years that I have not been able to wish someone Happy Mother’s Day. To those Mothers who might read this …I hope you had a happy Mother’s Day.

A light rain has fallen all day. So, very major progress was made today on organizing the living space at the cabin. By the end of the week I hope to have a wood stove working, the shop side of the cabin organized and the internet working.

The rainy day has caused the humming birds to spend what seems like most of their time around the feeder. I filled the quart feeder after the birds went to bed last night. By 1:00 p.m. it was empty. It is nearly 8:30 p.m. now and I can’t see any food in it. They will have consumed over one half gallon of sugar water today.

Charlie, the neighbor’s bear dog, is still with me. I get to keep her until the weather clears and the neighbors can get back down here. Thanks to Charlie’s being on guard she alerted me to a moose just across the river this morning. We watched her for a while till she crossed to our side and disappeared into the brush.

MAY 13th

About 12:30 this morning Charlie started having a fit. I grabbed a flashlight and let her out. She kept running around the outside of the cabin. The little LED flashlight didn’t help much in finding out what was out there. About a half hour later she was still very agitated. When I called her she came in and we settled down for the rest of the night.

About 6:30 she started up again. I thought that is a lot of baking for the little weasel. Now Charlie was going under the cabin sounding more aggressive than ever. As I came back into the shop an Otter disappeared into a space along the wall. There turned out to be two otters. Between Charlie and I giving them so much grief they have moved on to a quieter spot.

Good progress was made on cleaning up the accumulated stuff today. It rained on and off most of the day. Tomorrow if the weather cooperates I might start preparing to install the woodstove. I’m almost out of heating oil.

MAY 14th

Charlie got the morning off to good start for herself. She caught a sea gull out in front.

I did get started on preparing for the wood stove. The cabin has a plywood floor. Some time back the previous owner bought some laminate flooring but didn’t get a chance to install it. I got about half the floor done today. It didn’t go down nearly as easily as the last time I worked with that kind of flooring. Maybe sitting around in high humidity for several years had something to do with it. Anyway, now that the floor is finished under where the wood stove will be I can proceed to figure out to protect the floor and wall from the heat it will put out. I’m fairly motivated in that I am out of heating oil.

It was another rainy day. Fog came and went through the day. No small planes were flying. Because I am so near the ocean the temperatures stay very even. On a cloudy day like today the low might be 42 and the high for the day 48. All I have to do to stay warm is stay busy. Otherwise it requires several layers.

Since I have no radio and no internet I don’t know what the forecast is. Sometimes my little weather station shows the pressure going up. That means fair weather ahead. Then it changes its mind.

MAY 15th

The friends who are also neighbors arrived today. Three trips in the plane from Yakutat to get their cabins stocked for the season. Dinner with them this evening featured Beer Batter halibut for an appetizer. Meatloaf and red potatoes, fresh salad. All this was accompanied by great conversation and Buffalo Trace bourbon. It was a great meal.

I got the internet working late this morning. Now I can begin to learn how post pictures on this site so they are not upside down.

We got the outside chimney installed for the wood stove. I should have heat in the cabin tomorrow before noon.",MAY 15th,,inherit,open,open,,82-revision-v1,,,2013-10-22 08:27:23,2013-10-22 16:27:23,,82,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2013/10/22/82-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

Louis is traveling beautifully.  Wildflower ate all the gummy bears today but he made up for it by helping with the driving.  We have finished the first James Patterson book on tape.

714,3,2014-04-30 20:41:15,2014-05-01 04:41:15,"It has been a couple of days since I posted anything here.  Yesterday the 29th we made it into Haines after driving through more of the Yukon and back into British Columbia.    We saw some more caribou a few rabbits and a bunch of ground squirrels.  The terrain varied remarkably from high plains to rolling hills to very craggy mountains then we got to Haines.

Several years ago there was a book published entitled, If You Lived Here, I'd Know Your Name: News from Small-Town Alaska [Heather Lende].  The cover of the book showed a bull moose looking through an open doorway into a person’s home.  It was a great story about the goings on around Haines, AK.

I haven’t been to many of the smaller towns in Alaska but Haines has the friendliest people.  Everyone I saw looked me in the eye and smiled.  The clerks at the stores were friendly and helpful.  As I shopped for groceries I must have asked one guy, who was trying to stock shelves, for directions to the matches, blueberry pie filling, tang, sliced peaches and four or five other things on separate occasions.  Every time he stopped what he was doing and showed me where the item was.  At the lumber yard the same thing happened.  They even made some special cuts on a sheet of plywood and didn’t charge me for it.

Our original plan was to take the ferry down to Juneau to do the shopping but we figured by the time we paid for rooms a couple of nights and the cost of the round trip ferry ride we should just find what we needed in Haines and get on out here to Dry Bay and our cabins.

The flight over the mountains was amazing.  Paul the bush pilot said he would rather make two trips in his smaller plane and charge us the same as if we made one trip in the Beaver.  That worked out well in that on my load he actually taxied up into the yard in front of my cabin.  That made unloading very easy.  Wildflower’s cabin is about five miles away on the other side of Dry Bay.  On that load he landed near the other cabin.  It was much easier on both of us that way.

Louis, my dog, had never flown before.  He started out in the back of the small plane’s cargo area.  Before we finished taxing out for the takeoff he had crawled over all the stuff and was in my lap.  The rest of the one hour flight was very pleasant… for all three of us.

At the cabin everything seems to be in good shape.  There must have been a bad storm during the winter.  Lots of trees have their tops broken out.  Many of the trails are not passable without taking along an ax or saw to clear the limbs out of the way.  The beaches have been rearranged too.  What used to be nearly vertical sand dunes are now a sloping beaches.  The former sloping beaches now have five and six foot vertical faces at the high tide line.

I expected to have a problem getting reconnected to the internet.  That turned out to not be a problem.  However…..the water pump doesn’t pump water and this writer left the cables to the iPad and smart phone back in Boulder.  I have a spare water pump and Amazon will ship the needed cables to me in a jiffy.

Some beautiful photographs are stored on those devices but I can’t get them off till the cables come.  I could email them to myself if the batteries weren’t dead.  Beside the beautiful scenery I got pictures of several hundred Steller Sea Lions that are hanging out down near the mouth of one of the rivers near the cabin.  I’ll pass those along when the needed cables arrive.

It is the old fashioned kind that has the little basket you put the grounds in and heat the water on the stove.  After a few minutes it starts making a gurgling sound.  Steam starts coming out of the pour spout and that fills the cabin with an aroma that causes one to get the cup ready so not a moment is lost when you decide the coffee is strong enough.  It was great coffee.  

Louis and I went for a short walk around outside this morning.  He looked to the west and started barking.  I couldn’t see anything and he soon settled down.  Later I drove up the beach to look for treasures that might have washed ashore on the tide.

No treasure but Louis’s barking was valid.  Just across the creek from the cabin there were fresh tracks of four wolves.  These tracks were not there yesterday afternoon.  The wolves went down toward the mouth of the river for about a mile then turned back into the brush.  Two moose had also been over there since yesterday as well as one set of bear tracks.  I didn’t lay eyes on any of these critters but their tracks prove they were around last night.

The first humming bird stopped by today.  She visited the feeder several times throughout the day.  In a week or so there will be dozens of these little beauties buzzing around out front.  Once I looked out and a Bald Eagle flew right past the window.  There are not many eagles around yet but I expect there will be plenty as the fish start coming into the streams.

The spare pump works just fine.  One other item I needed to check out was the washing machine.  I put antifreeze in the pump last September to keep it from freezing.   To be sure there were no leaks I ran a load of dirty clothes through.  It worked just fine.  Later the clothes drying on the line outside surprised Louis.  He barked at them flapping in the breeze.  He is so much company….he protects me from anything strange…like unknown things flapping in the breeze.

Treasurer hunting took me across the East Alsek River this morning. I left before high tide. The water was still too deep to ride the wheeler all the way across. When I stepped off the machine the current was swift enough that the Honda wanted to tip over. After getting that under control we were able to get back into shallower water and proceed on to the Pacific Ocean.

This Old Stellar Sea Lion bull washed in on last night’s tide. He was over 9 feet long. For comparison the Honda is about 6.5 feet long. I tried to roll the old guy over for a better picture but there was no way. He must have weighed well over a thousand pounds.

I rode as far as I could down the beach until I was stopped by a rock formation. That is about 12 miles one way. The only tracks I saw were made by bears and only a couple of them. I was sure I would find some old glass fishing floats on the long stretch of beach. My guess is no one had been down there since last fall sometime. I did find a fiberglass boat about 18 feet long and a couple of other interesting things. That’s a whale vertebrae along with a fishing gaff, an interesting bottle and another coffee mug for the cabin.

A long time friend who lives a ways north of Dallas suggested I add some maps to these notes for reference. So here we go Bill:

If you go to Google Maps and enter the following in the ""directions to box"" 59.106074, -138.477199 the map should zoom into Alaska. Choose the satilite view.  The green arrow is my cabin. At least it is when I do that on my computer.

If the Google Maps location worked for you then this is what the cabin looks like as you fly in in a bush plane.  You would land right at the edge of the grass in front of the cabin.  That is Dog Salmon Creek in the foreground.  The Ease Alsek River is just off the right edge of the picture and the ocean is beyond that to the right.

This is a high altitude shot.  The yellow lines are indications of where Rick was a couple of days last summer.  He loaded information from his GPS into Google and those uploaded tracks are the yellow lines.  The line extending toward the lower center of the picture ends at the rocks where I was yesterday.  The other end of that line which ends abruptly in the foggy area is the mouth of the mighty Alsek river.

This is a high altitude shot.  The yellow lines are indications of where Rick was a couple of days last summer.  He loaded information from his GPS into Google and those uploaded tracks are the yellow lines.  The line extending toward the lower center of the picture ends at the rocks where I was yesterday.  The other end of that line which ends abruptly in the foggy area is the mouth of the mighty Alsek river.

Thanks Bill for the suggestion and my very best wishes for you and your family.",May 3rd,,inherit,open,open,,725-revision-v1,,,2014-05-03 21:26:06,2014-05-04 05:26:06,,725,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2014/05/03/725-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

Earlier in the day I did go down to the mouth of the Alsek.  No luck beachcombing but there was one chunk of glacier ice.  I brought it home and now the cooler has a way to keep things cool.  I had the first Kentucky Bourbon and water chilled with glacier ice of the season yesterday.  Have been needing a long straight pole to mount the VHF radio antenna on.  I found a couple that had washed ashore and drug them home behind the Honda.

So just before we retired we stepped outside.  Louis went around the south side of the cabin and immediately went stiff then began to bark his serious bark.  There was a mama grizzly in the side yard with twin cubs.  We both started barking seriously.  Mama stood up on her hind legs and checked us out.  I guess she and the cubs had a quick conference and decided to turn tail.  They crashed off into the alders and didn’t return as far as we know.

Today we looked for moose antlers out in the brush for an hour or so.  I called wildflower and asked him if he would come over and help me get the new VHF antenna installed.  All I needed him to do was eyeball the position of the antenna from the ground to be sure it was vertical.  The other thing I needed him for was to call the coast guard in case I fell off the roof.

To pay back the favor we spent a couple of hours clearing the windfalls off the trail back to his cabin.  As mentioned before there was a heck of a storm here a month or so ago.  The tops are blown out of many trees across the whole area.  Our guess is an ice storm preceded a strong wind.

Tomorrow the plan is to get the solar panel installed.  Its job is to help keep the bank of 12 volt batteries charged.  Wish me luck.  I’ll be back on the roof.

The forecast calls for a 40% chance of rain later in the week.

This afternoon I went exploring back in the bush. There are some beautiful meadows hidden from view along the trails. Some of the meadows have what should be a small stream running through the middle. Because it is so dry there are pools of water but no water connecting the pools. Each of these pools has several minnow size fish in them. I bet some of them are tiny salmon. A good rain might help some of them escape into larger water, grow up and make more salmon.

While out exploring I came across this wolf skull. To give it some scale the squares in the tablecloth are almost one inch on each side. The teeth are not worn very much indicating it wasn’t an old animal. Makes you wonder what happened to it.

Down the beach again this morning. This time scouting for fire wood. There are several areas where during storms with wind and high water logs pile up along the river’s bank.

One of these places is across the Alsek River from where the Stellar Sea Lions congregate this time of year. The day I took this picture there were probably a couple hundred of them down there. Today about half that many. You can hear these animals roar and bark miles away if the wind is right.

My side of the river is where I find fire wood. This tree is over one hundred feet long not counting the top which was broken off.  I was looking for something a little closer to the cabin and bigger in diameter.

&nbsp;

A little closer to the cabin I cut up this spruce log for the stove. It took two trips to haul these sawn up pieces back to the cabin. I think I have decided to cut up slightly smaller diameter trees next time. It takes a lot of work to split up these big trees into fire wood size. On or two of those pieces will heat the cabin all day though after it is split.

748,3,2014-05-09 21:44:37,2014-05-10 05:44:37,"Not much happened yesterday except I split the three loads of firewood cut the day before. Late in the evening Louis and I were watching the day wind down and we noticed flocks of Snow Geese flying in a northerly direction down the East Alsek River. These birds would circle around a spot on the beach several times before landing. No telling how far they had flown that day. Anyway I expected them to begin feeding in the grass along the shore of the river. Nope, they must have been worn out in that almost all of them tucked their heads under a wing and went wherever geese go when they are really tired.

Today started out like yesterday. Went down the river and cut another load of firewood. On the way I ran into Wildflower. He suggested we go and salvage that boat I found washed ashore down by the rocks a few days ago.

We found a shallower place to cross the East River and we could just ride the Hondas across. He pulled his boat trailer and we blasted down the beach nearly the entire twelve miles to the boat.

As you can see it was another beautiful day. That’s Mt. Fairweather in the background. My wheeler tracks from the earlier trip in the foreground. We thought this would be about a 12 foot boat. Note the timestamp on the picture is 4:35.

The picture below was taken at 6:18 and the boat has grown to about 18 or 20 feet in length and very deep in the sand. We did discover some markings on the side of the boat. It appears it a Japanese vessel from the registration numbers and markings.

We tried several ways to pry the boat loose from the sand. Finally we got the bow end free but the stern is still stuck.

By now both us old guys were pretty much beat and we decided to call it a day at 7:15. We left the trailer down there with the boat. The plan is to resume the attack in the morning. You can see from the sand on her hull how much of the boat was covered with sand. That’s wildflower holding on to his Honda. He was so tired he was about to tip over ….So was I!

A  distraction while digging was the activity out in the ocean.  The noisy Sea Lions were around and for the first time for me  I saw whales migrating up the coast.  It was easy to spot the vapor as they exhaled and rolled back under the waves. We saw two different groups and no telling how many went by while we had our heads down in the sand.",May 9th,,publish,open,open,,may-9th,,,2014-05-09 21:44:37,2014-05-10 05:44:37,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=748,0,post,,4

752,3,2014-05-09 21:44:37,2014-05-10 05:44:37,"Not much happened yesterday except I split the three loads of firewood cut the day before. Late in the evening Louis and I were watching the day wind down and we noticed flocks of Snow Geese flying in a northerly direction down the East Alsek River. These birds would circle around a spot on the beach several times before landing. No telling how far they had flown that day. Anyway I expected them to begin feeding in the grass along the shore of the river. Nope, they must have been worn out in that almost all of them tucked their heads under a wing and went wherever geese go when they are really tired.

Today started out like yesterday. Went down the river and cut another load of firewood. On the way I ran into Wildflower. He suggested we go and salvage that boat I found washed ashore down by the rocks a few days ago.

We found a shallower place to cross the East River and we could just ride the Hondas across. He pulled his boat trailer and we blasted down the beach nearly the entire twelve miles to the boat.

As you can see it was another beautiful day. That’s Mt. Fairweather in the background. My wheeler tracks from the earlier trip in the foreground. We thought this would be about a 12 foot boat. Note the timestamp on the picture is 4:35.

The picture below was taken at 6:18 and the boat has grown to about 18 or 20 feet in length and very deep in the sand. We did discover some markings on the side of the boat. It appears it a Japanese vessel from the registration numbers and markings.

We tried several ways to pry the boat loose from the sand. Finally we got the bow end free but the stern is still stuck.

By now both us old guys were pretty much beat and we decided to call it a day at 7:15. We left the trailer down there with the boat. The plan is to resume the attack in the morning. You can see from the sand on her hull how much of the boat was covered with sand. That’s wildflower holding on to his Honda. He was so tired he was about to tip over ….So was I!

A  distraction while digging was the activity out in the ocean.  The noisy Sea Lions were around and for the first time for me  I saw whales migrating up the coast.  It was easy to spot the vapor as they exhaled and rolled back under the waves. We saw two different groups and no telling how many went by while we had our heads down in the sand.",May 9th,,inherit,open,open,,748-revision-v1,,,2014-05-09 21:44:37,2014-05-10 05:44:37,,748,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2014/05/09/748-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

This morning I planned to split all the loads of wood I cut yesterday and I figured I had all day to get it done. Then Wildflower pulled up. He wondered if I would like to help him get his boat in the water. After that we would check out some places to set our nets when the season opens on June first.

Wildflower has been coming up here and fishing for over 25 years. I was happy that he asked me to partner with him for fishing on the Alsek River this year. Neither one of us are spring chickens any more. He is older than me (10 days) and obviously has a lot more experience. I however have a fuller beard and other important qualities which don’t come to mind right now but I’m sure they are there somewhere.

This is a picture of one of the places where we will set a net. Along here today there were at least a dozen Bald Eagles. In one spot I could see three eagle nests. The second picture is yet another shot of Mount Fairweather.

I needed some ice for the cooler so while we were on the river we grabbed a couple of chunks of glacier ice. What we found was crystal clear. Old ice he called it. Newer ice near the surface of the glacier is cloudy and softer. As we went up and down the river the air temperature would vary dramatically. Wildflower has a device on his boat that tells him the water temp. In several places the water was less than 33.5 degrees.

This morning I planned to split all the loads of wood I cut yesterday and I figured I had all day to get it done. Then Wildflower pulled up. He wondered if I would like to help him get his boat in the water. After that we would check out some places to set our nets when the season opens on June first.

Wildflower has been coming up here and fishing for over 25 years. I was happy that he asked me to partner with him for fishing on the Alsek River this year. Neither one of us are spring chickens any more. He is older than me (10 days) and obviously has a lot more experience. I however have a fuller beard and other important qualities which don’t come to mind right now but I’m sure they are there somewhere.

This is a picture of one of the places where we will set a net. Along here today there were at least a dozen Bald Eagles. In one spot I could see three eagle nests. The second picture is yet another shot of Mount Fairweather.

I needed some ice for the cooler so while we were on the river we grabbed a couple of chunks of glacier ice. What we found was crystal clear. Old ice he called it. Newer ice near the surface of the glacier is cloudy and softer. As we went up and down the river the air temperature would vary dramatically. Wildflower has a device on his boat that tells him the water temp. In several places the water was less than 33.5 degrees.

The fishing regulations on the rivers I fish specify how many fathoms (length) of net I can have in the water at one time. They specify the minimum and maximum length of the nets. Size has to do with the opening of the webbing the net is made of. Smaller fish can swim right through a net sized to catch a larger fish. A large fish can’t get far enough into a smaller webbing to be caught. Depth is the number webs from the top to the bottom of the net.

So yesterday when I mentioned targeting a fish 120 feet away that referred to the maximum length (25 fathoms) net I can fish. A web opening of 6.5 inches will hold a good size King Salmon but a Sockeye will be able to swim through it.

790,3,2014-05-18 19:59:38,2014-05-19 03:59:38,"Yesterday was pretty quiet so nothing got posted here.  After working on sorting the nets for a couple of days, decisions were made about which ones to save/repair and those that ended up in the burn pile.  Four of the ones to be repaired got loaded into the two totes and hauled over to Wildflower’s rack.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/double-tote.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-791"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/double-tote.jpg"" alt=""double tote"" width=""800"" height=""450"" /></a>

Today had a little more going on so here we go.  Mid-morning I blasted off to Wildflower’s place to start helping repair the nets.  He patiently showed me over and over how to throw a half hitch knot onto the lead line of the net.  After the first half hitch you wrap the cord used to hold the net on the lead line around twice then add another half hitch.  After that you carefully move down the line three webs and do it all over again.  Remember how some of these nets are 120 feet long and besides the bottom lead line there is the same thing to do on the float line in addition to keeping the floats evenly spaced.  That's a lot of half hitches!  This particular net needed to have the weighted line at the bottom of the net (lead line) patched on both ends.  The float line was OK.

As we got the first end finished the VHF radio came to life.  One of the bush pilots radioed in that he was about to land on the strip about a mile from Wildflower’s cabin.  The plane was delivering the first of two loads of gear for two fish camps over on that side of Dry Bay.

Hans can pack a lot of stuff into that DeHaveland Otter.  The other load was bigger than this one.  It had the parts to build two tote trailers like those in the first picture above as well as the totes themselves and a new Honda ATV like you see in that same picture.

I bailed out on finishing the net we had started and headed home.  On the way I checked out a trail through the bush that will be easier for me to move the boat over to the Alsek River next week.  As I approached the cabin I saw…

this large flock (couple of hundred) of Snow Geese grazing in the grasses out in front of my cabin.  They must have been enjoying the salad.  I flushed them as I crossed Dog Salmon Creek but they settled right back down after I passed.  Mixed in with all the Snows were some Lesser Canada Geese, White Fronted Geese and there were a couple of Emperor Geese in there too.

As this is being typed Louis is barking outside.  He has gotten pretty comfortable with the space around the cabin.  He has a regular circuit he patrols when he goes out.  The reason for the barking are the geese.  They usually are not out there and anything different in his patrol area causes him to sound an alarm that means; “John! Something is different out here.  You better have a look!”.

I did have a look.  The geese have moved across the sand and are almost into the grass in front.  They are beautiful. They don't seem to mind an old dog fussing at them.  They don't mind Louis either.",May 18th,,publish,open,open,,may-18th,,,2014-05-18 19:59:38,2014-05-19 03:59:38,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=790,0,post,,0

794,3,2014-05-18 19:59:38,2014-05-19 03:59:38,"Yesterday was pretty quiet so nothing got posted here.  After working on sorting the nets for a couple of days, decisions were made about which ones to save/repair and those that ended up in the burn pile.  Four of the ones to be repaired got loaded into the two totes and hauled over to Wildflower’s rack.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/double-tote.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-791"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/double-tote.jpg"" alt=""double tote"" width=""800"" height=""450"" /></a>

Today had a little more going on so here we go.  Mid-morning I blasted off to Wildflower’s place to start helping repair the nets.  He patiently showed me over and over how to throw a half hitch knot onto the lead line of the net.  After the first half hitch you wrap the cord used to hold the net on the lead line around twice then add another half hitch.  After that you carefully move down the line three webs and do it all over again.  Remember how some of these nets are 120 feet long and besides the bottom lead line there is the same thing to do on the float line in addition to keeping the floats evenly spaced.  That's a lot of half hitches!  This particular net needed to have the weighted line at the bottom of the net (lead line) patched on both ends.  The float line was OK.

As we got the first end finished the VHF radio came to life.  One of the bush pilots radioed in that he was about to land on the strip about a mile from Wildflower’s cabin.  The plane was delivering the first of two loads of gear for two fish camps over on that side of Dry Bay.

Hans can pack a lot of stuff into that DeHaveland Otter.  The other load was bigger than this one.  It had the parts to build two tote trailers like those in the first picture above as well as the totes themselves and a new Honda ATV like you see in that same picture.

I bailed out on finishing the net we had started and headed home.  On the way I checked out a trail through the bush that will be easier for me to move the boat over to the Alsek River next week.  As I approached the cabin I saw…

this large flock (couple of hundred) of Snow Geese grazing in the grasses out in front of my cabin.  They must have been enjoying the salad.  I flushed them as I crossed Dog Salmon Creek but they settled right back down after I passed.  Mixed in with all the Snows were some Lesser Canada Geese, White Fronted Geese and there were a couple of Emperor Geese in there too.

As this is being typed Louis is barking outside.  He has gotten pretty comfortable with the space around the cabin.  He has a regular circuit he patrols when he goes out.  The reason for the barking are the geese.  They usually are not out there and anything different in his patrol area causes him to sound an alarm that means; “John! Something is different out here.  You better have a look!”.

I did have a look.  The geese have moved across the sand and are almost into the grass in front.  They are beautiful. They don't seem to mind an old dog fussing at them.  They don't mind Louis either.",May 18th,,inherit,open,open,,790-revision-v1,,,2014-05-18 19:59:38,2014-05-19 03:59:38,,790,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2014/05/18/790-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

The weather forecaster was correct.  It started intermittent rain about three this morning.  As the day went on it became heavy at times then late this afternoon it has stopped.  There has been a steady 15 to 20 mph wind all day.  It is still very cloudy.  You can see the bottom of the mountains but the clouds are very thick above that.

Because of the weather all I got done today was hang a thermometer.  It took four nails.  There was a lot of activity outside today in spite of the wind and rain.

Each spring thousands if not millions of small sardine size fish come up the river in schools.  There are so many of these fish in the water there are darker areas where they are swimming.  I first noticed the activity because of a congregation of eagles.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/eagles2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-799"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/eagles2.jpg"" alt=""eagles2"" width=""800"" height=""533"" /></a>

In the picture there are 18 Bald Eagles.  These huge raptors would hover in the wind mimicking humming birds, then drop down into the shallow water to catch the fish.  At one point I counted 26 eagles over that school of fish

Downstream the gulls had their own school of fish to feed on.  I rode over there on the Honda.  The wind at my back the gulls ignored me as they held steady, facing into the wind and me.  From the splashing water and whitecaps you can see how strong the wind was.

The eagles had moved on so another gang of gulls were working on that school.  With that side view of the action you could see the fish the gulls were catching.  As I watched, a gull would spread its wings and let the wind lift it off the water.  Sometimes the bird would drop the fish it had in its beak and dive back for another. The gull in the upper right of the picture has a fish.  Frenzy seems to be the proper word for what I witnessed.  A new sight for me but it has been happening here for thousands of years.  All of this happened just out my front door.  At one time I bet there were a thousand gull resting out there.

Late this afternoon Louis and I took a walk over to the creek just to chase the Snow geese into the air.  My neighbor was nearby cleaning some Sockeye he had caught.  The neighbor is an Alaskan Native and can fish earlier than nonresidents.  He gave me a fillet.  .  In about ten minutes it was in the 400 degree oven with just a little seasoning on it.  Eighteen minutes later Louis got down off the bed and came over to see what was cooking.  It was delicious.",May 19th,,publish,open,open,,may-19th-2,,,2014-05-19 19:43:52,2014-05-20 03:43:52,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=796,0,post,,2

Oh boy, where to begin?  Didn’t post anything yesterday but after looking at the pictures there was plenty to write about.

Louis and I took a long walk down the river.  The wolves had preceded us.  The picture is not very good but Louis’ print is to the right of the wolf’s.  Louis is a 72 pound dog.  His print is about half the size of the wolf’s.  Two of them left new prints out front last night.

Spring is happening now in a very big way.  It has been so warm all month.  Plants are growing several inches each day.  The yard out front has hundreds of these Shooting Stars and Wild Strawberries blooming.

Kaytlynn and family stopped by last evening.  It is inspiring, this young couple making a life here in the wilderness with a three month old baby.  They are building a cabin up the creek from mine.  They let me hold baby Fathom if I have showered recently.

Today I got the boat ready to put in the water.  It is about 5 miles to where we keep the boats out of the current in the Alsek River.

&nbsp;

After putting the boat in the river I thought I would give her a test run.  After backing away from the shore about thirty feet she began to falter.  The engine sounded the same but she would surge then stall over and over.  I went forward and after about sixty feet the same thing happened.  Note; this is a brand new outboard I bought late last simmer for many $$.  Then I discovered the problem…I had not pulled the anchor up!

On the way back home I stopped to see if there were any fish coming in at the mouth of the East River.  The population in this part of Alaska is so small you never know when you might run into someone you know.  At the river Les, a guy we have all used as a bush pilot, had landed on the ocean beach and was fishing there in the river.  That is the Pacific Ocean in the background.  I did see one King Salmon cruse by.  It was s smallish one.  ONLY about twenty pounds!

Yesterday afternoon I went fishing again.  The King Salmon are back in the river.  No matter what I cast to them they would not bite.  I noted the time and tide level.  This morning at the same relative tide level I was back out there.  I fished for three hours and only caught one small flounder.  The dollies were not even biting.  So I thought I would try and find some ice for the cooler.

the cooler.  I found this eight foot long chunk on shore at the mouth of the river but the waves were breaking around it.  I didn't want or need the ice that bad so no luck fishing for ice either.

This afternoon my neighbor stopped in and said there were lots of Kings back in the river.  I blasted off down there thinking maybe I could fish a while and maybe catch more than a small flounder.  On the very first cast look what came in:

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/firstking.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-814"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/firstking.jpg"" alt=""firstking"" width=""800"" height=""450"" /></a>

That's my size 13 insulated boot in below the fish.  It was about 40 inches long and weighed maybe 20 pounds.  I didn't have the proper license so I  returned it to the water.  These big fish put up a terrific fight.  My neighbor came down to try his luck.  Same result:

Note the bent rod.    In the next hour I hooked two more Kings.  They both broke off.  One was a really big fish.  From where I hooked that second fish I had to follow it about two hundred yards down the river bank.  It was taking so much line at one point I was running to keep it from taking all the line off my reel.  It was nearly back into the ocean breakers at the mouth of the river before the line broke. Later I managed to catch this sockeye.  Louis and I will bake this guy for dinner real soon.

The neighbor suggested I might have better fishing if I went to the river three or four hours before low tide instead of at the low tide.  In his words ""fish the outgoing tide"".  I did that and caught two nice Kings in the first twenty minutes.  After that one could see these big fish in the water but they quit biting.  Lock Jaw!  I released both fish.  I don't want to have to run the generator to keep them frozen and a King Salmon can feed nearly 20 people.  Tonight Lisa cooked a King caught yesterday.  It fed 11 adults and more than half of it was left over.  Unless I have some way to dispose of the fish I shouldn't keep them.

So with that said you can see my day began and ended eating King Salmon and the middle of the day was spent catching them.

The other thing that I remember happening was the Barn Swallows showed up.  They are a little earlier than last year.  They make themselves noticed by insisting on trying to swoop into the workshop looking for a place to build their mud nest.  Last year trying to keep them out I hung a fishing net across the open doorway.  Those swallows are so agile they would fly through the webbing of the net.  This year I drove a nail above the center of the door opening and hung my big raincoat from it.  As the coat moves around in the breeze it must look like me because the birds are staying out.  In another attempt to deter them last year, my neighbor from Boulder made a nesting platform for them and hung it on the north side of the cabin.  The swallows ending up building their nest on the east side.

Today there was a little more going on.  Early, Louis and I rode down the river looking for some more good logs to build the wood storage shed.  I got him to ride down and back on the Honda with me.  He doesn't like getting on it but seems to enjoy the ride.  He sometimes has trouble getting settled on the back of the machine.  This afternoon he helped me build a bigger platform, one with a raised edge to give him something to brace against as we motor along.  I'll take a picture some day.  While down there we saw a really mangy looking coyote.  Louis chased it a short distance.

Later in the morning did catch two more King Salmon.  I let another one get away due to rod and reel operator carelessness.  Gave one to a neighbor and let the third one go.

One of the fishermen with a cabin nearby lives near Phoenix.  I went by his place today just to check on it.  No problem to report.  While I was over that way I did a little exploring on trails I had never been over before.  There were two grizzlies in a beautiful meadow.  I must have interrupted whatever they were up to.  It is impressive how quickly those bears can disappear into the brush.  Not far from there I found a moose antler.

This picture was taken in the side yard.  The antler is resting among a few of the millions of Strawberry blooms and nearly as many Shooting Stars that adorn our part of Alaska in the spring.  A new blossom just starting to show up are the dark blue Wild Blue Flax below the left side of the antler.  A few Artic Lupine are starting to bloom.  In a couple of weeks there will be acres and acres of them too.

<a href=""http://www.alaskadispatch.com/slideshow/photos-place-where-2-oceans-meet-gulf-alaska"">The Gulf of Alaska has also been known as the place where 2 oceans meet.</a> Photographer Kent Smith snapped this photo of glacial waters from Alaska rivers merging with the darker blue waters of the Gulf of Alaska while on a cruise on July 10, 2010.   This picture of the Gulf of Alaska has been on the Internet for the last few year shows a strange natural phenomenon that occurs when heavy, sediment-laden water from glacial valleys and rivers pours into the open ocean. There in the gulf, the two types of water run into each other, <a href=""http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2008/03/GOABoundaryLG.jpg"">a light, almost electric blue merging with a darker slate-blue</a>.

Informally dubbed “the place where two oceans meet,” the explanation for the photo is a simple one, though there are many misconceptions about it, including that catchy title.and the two types of water as being completely incapable of ever mixing, instead perpetually butting against each other like a boundary on a map.   That original photo, however, originates from a <a href=""http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2008/03/"">2007 research cruise</a> of oceanographers studying the role that iron plays in the Gulf of Alaska, and how that iron reaches certain areas in the northern Pacific. Ken Bruland, professor of ocean sciences at University of California-Santa Cruz, was on that cruise. In fact, he was the one who snapped the pic. He said the purpose of the cruise was to examine how huge eddies -- slow moving currents -- ranging into the hundreds of kilometers in diameter, swirl out from the Alaska coast into the Gulf of Alaska.   “Glacier rivers in the summertime are like buzzsaws eroding away the mountains there,” Bruland said. “In the process, they lift up all this material -- they call it glacial flour -- that can be carried out.” Once these glacial rivers pour out into the larger body of water, they’re picked up by ocean currents, moving east to west, and begin to circulate there. This is one of the primary methods that iron -- found in the clay and sediment of the glacial runoff -- is transported to iron-deprived regions in the middle of the Gulf of Alaska.

As for that specific photo, Bruland said that it shows the plume of water pouring out from one of these sediment-rich rivers and meeting with the general ocean water. It’s also a falsehood that these two types of water don’t mix at all, he said.   “They do eventually mix, but you do come across these really strong gradients at these specific moments in time,” he said. Such borders are never static, he added, as they move around and disappear altogether, depending on the level of sediment and the whims of the water.   But rivers aren’t the only way that glacier sediment finds its way into the Gulf of Alaska -- occasionally strong winds can whip up enough silt to create a cloud of dust that’s <a href=""http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/blog/archives/11629"">visible even from space</a> as its being carried out to sea.

It is not unusual to see this plume right here at Dry Bay.  There are glacier fed rivers on both sides of us.  If you dip a glass of that glacial water out of the river the ""flower"" will settle out and perfectly clear water will be on top.  If you are really thirsty though you can just drink the water right out of the river.  The glacial flower is good fiber for one's system.",May 30th,,publish,open,open,,may-30th-2,,,2014-05-30 20:44:17,2014-05-31 04:44:17,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=835,0,post,,4

<a href=""http://www.alaskadispatch.com/slideshow/photos-place-where-2-oceans-meet-gulf-alaska"">The Gulf of Alaska has also been known as the place where 2 oceans meet.</a> Photographer Kent Smith snapped this photo of glacial waters from Alaska rivers merging with the darker blue waters of the Gulf of Alaska while on a cruise on July 10, 2010.   This picture of the Gulf of Alaska has been on the Internet for the last few year shows a strange natural phenomenon that occurs when heavy, sediment-laden water from glacial valleys and rivers pours into the open ocean. There in the gulf, the two types of water run into each other, <a href=""http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2008/03/GOABoundaryLG.jpg"">a light, almost electric blue merging with a darker slate-blue</a>.

Informally dubbed “the place where two oceans meet,” the explanation for the photo is a simple one, though there are many misconceptions about it, including that catchy title.and the two types of water as being completely incapable of ever mixing, instead perpetually butting against each other like a boundary on a map.   That original photo, however, originates from a <a href=""http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2008/03/"">2007 research cruise</a> of oceanographers studying the role that iron plays in the Gulf of Alaska, and how that iron reaches certain areas in the northern Pacific. Ken Bruland, professor of ocean sciences at University of California-Santa Cruz, was on that cruise. In fact, he was the one who snapped the pic. He said the purpose of the cruise was to examine how huge eddies -- slow moving currents -- ranging into the hundreds of kilometers in diameter, swirl out from the Alaska coast into the Gulf of Alaska.   “Glacier rivers in the summertime are like buzzsaws eroding away the mountains there,” Bruland said. “In the process, they lift up all this material -- they call it glacial flour -- that can be carried out.” Once these glacial rivers pour out into the larger body of water, they’re picked up by ocean currents, moving east to west, and begin to circulate there. This is one of the primary methods that iron -- found in the clay and sediment of the glacial runoff -- is transported to iron-deprived regions in the middle of the Gulf of Alaska.

As for that specific photo, Bruland said that it shows the plume of water pouring out from one of these sediment-rich rivers and meeting with the general ocean water. It’s also a falsehood that these two types of water don’t mix at all, he said.   “They do eventually mix, but you do come across these really strong gradients at these specific moments in time,” he said. Such borders are never static, he added, as they move around and disappear altogether, depending on the level of sediment and the whims of the water.   But rivers aren’t the only way that glacier sediment finds its way into the Gulf of Alaska -- occasionally strong winds can whip up enough silt to create a cloud of dust that’s <a href=""http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/blog/archives/11629"">visible even from space</a> as its being carried out to sea.

It is not unusual to see this plume right here at Dry Bay.  There are glacier fed rivers on both sides of us.  If you dip a glass of that glacial water out of the river the ""flower"" will settle out and perfectly clear water will be on top.  If you are really thirsty though you can just drink the water right out of the river.  The glacial flower is good fiber for one's system.",May 30th,,inherit,open,open,,835-revision-v1,,,2014-05-30 20:44:17,2014-05-31 04:44:17,,835,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2014/05/30/835-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

A little while ago this morning we got word from the wildlife biologist that there were enough fish in the river to allow a second day of fishing.  Usually the first opening is for just one day.  By extending the opening until noon tomorrow means there must be a pretty good run of fish this year.  It also means another long day and short night.  I'm looking forward to a good nap tomorrow afternoon.

That big guy is a King Salmon (24 pounds) the others are all Sockeye.  The sockeye are running a little over 6 pounds each.

&nbsp;

The twitching went on for longer than usual and their frequency was different.  I raised up in bed to see if Louis was OK.  He was sound asleep.  The rocking chair was rocking back and forth.  The towel hanging near the stove to dry was swaying back and forth.  There is little rack over the stove where I hang wet gloves to dry them out.  They were dancing.  We were having an earthquake.  This went on for several seconds.  Long enough for me to wake completely up and think about tsunamis.  Then all was quiet.  I wondered if the VHF radio would come alive with some sort of announcement.  It didn’t.  Louis never woke up.

This morning I checked the internet.  The epicenter was about 20 miles from here in the direction of Haines.  It was a 5.8 quake.  Big enough to make the national news I subscribe to.

School must be out up here.  Less, the bush pilot mentioned earlier, brought an outfitter friend and his family down to fish for the Kings in the river.  Less and I watched a fish attack the lure Sarah was using.  We could see the chrome flashing in the water.  Then this big brown shape appeared behind the lure and it disappeared.  The next thing was he and I both saying “he got it”.  Then in about a half second Sarah’s rod bent way over and she yelled “I got one”.  Then there was a pop.  The fish broke off.  Later we could see the lure, still in the fishes mouth, sparkle in the water.  I guess he got tired of the jewelry though.  In a few minutes that same fish exploded out of the water in four terrific leaps and threw the flashing lure back at us.

Back to school letting out.  This evening another small plane kept circling around near the mouth of the river.  It landed not far from the cabin.  I went over and met Melissa, Crawford and daughter Scarlett.  They are going to camp out just across the creek from here for a couple of days.  They came well equipped.  An electric fence to erect around their tent.  Their tent they explained was a killer of a tent.  They had never set it up before.  Their plan is to do a little fishing.  I lent them one of the Hondas so they won’t have to walk so far to the fishing spot.  Scarlett has just become a third grader.

This morning I checked the internet.  The epicenter was about 20 miles from here in the direction of Haines.  It was a 5.8 quake.  Big enough to make the national news I subscribe to.

School must be out up here.  Less, the bush pilot mentioned earlier, brought an outfitter friend and his family down to fish for the Kings in the river.  Less and I watched a fish attack the lure Sarah was using.  We could see the chrome flashing in the water.  Then this big brown shape appeared behind the lure and it disappeared.  The next thing was he and I both saying “he got it”.  Then in about a half second Sarah’s rod bent way over and she yelled “I got one”.  Then there was a pop.  The fish broke off.  Later we could see the lure, still in the fishes mouth, sparkle in the water.  I guess he got tired of the jewelry though.  In a few minutes that same fish exploded out of the water in four terrific leaps and threw the flashing lure back at us.

Back to school letting out.  This evening another small plane kept circling around near the mouth of the river.  It landed not far from the cabin.  I went over and met Melissa, Crawford and daughter Scarlett.  They are going to camp out just across the creek from here for a couple of days.  They came well equipped.  An electric fence to erect around their tent.  Their tent they explained was a killer of a tent.  They had never set it up before.  Their plan is to do a little fishing.  I lent them one of the Hondas so they won’t have to walk so far to the fishing spot.  Scarlett has just become a third grader.

Most of the day was spent doing chores.  Two loads of fishy clothes, returned borrowed things, installed a new drum of fuel on the rack, watched a grizzly watch me, vacuum packed the salmon I caught a couple of days ago and shared my dinner with Louis.",June 4th,,inherit,open,open,,854-revision-v1,,,2014-06-04 20:26:58,2014-06-05 04:26:58,,854,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2014/06/04/854-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

There are a few Sockeye in the East River now.  No luck casting to them but I did get a good look at the wolf's tracks on that side of the river.  Its paw prints are as big as the palm paet of my hand.

Slim Pickins  asked me if I would help him address a bat problem in an older building his family owns.  To shorten this part of tonight's post I'll just say we removed ALL the insulation in the attic of the building.

Rain, Rain, Rain more Rain.  That’s OK though it is supposed to rain here.

Yesterday at the bonfire Wildflower and I decided to get a head start on tomorrow’s opener by laying out nets on the shore where we plane to fish tomorrow.  There won’t be much tide tonight so they should be OK.

On the way over there I was travelling with the wind at my back.  That meant no rain was blowing down my shirt front.  Traveling along one of the backwater sloughs an otter popped out and ran across the trail.  That one was followed by six more.  They loped along one after the other like a brown slinky toy.  Reminded me of pearls on a string the way they followed each other.

I reduced an iceberg in size by chopping some much needed ice for the cooler from along its margins.  Not wanting to come home to the empty cabin too soon I stopped by an island where the sea gulls nest.  Most of the nests have three eggs in them now.  There are even some chicks in a few of them.  The gulls usually lay three eggs before they start to sit on them.  If the nest has only one or two eggs in it one can know she is not finished laying.  As said earlier, most nests have three eggs.  There will be a lot more gulls around before summer’s end.  Travelling home the wind and rain had picked up and were now in my face.  You can only pull the drawstring so tight on your hood to keep the rain out.

The highlight of the day happened about thirty minutes ago.  Louis had been holding the bed down all day and he decided he needed to take me for a walk.  We went around the side of the cabin and down a trail that leads out to the river.  About a quarter mile into the hike we reached a little clearing at EXACTLY the same time a grizzly did.  This bear was less than 50 feet away.  About the time I thought “that’s a bear” Louis was in full voice explaining to me in his “John, this is serious” voice.  In a lot less time than it takes to type this he had the bear on its way into the brush on the other side of the trail.  Then the second bear came out.  A cub!  Most bad bear encounters up here involve someone or something getting between the Mama bear and her cub.  There we were, Mama on the right side of the trail, Louis and I separated by 50 feet or so in the middle of the trail and the cub on the left side of the trail.  The cub solved the problem for us.  Like a fur covered chocolate brown donut hole the size of a large beach ball the cub caught up with Mama and they vanished.

Louis was so proud.  He had had a close encounter of the bear kind and was still around to bark about it.  I’m proud of my bear dog too.

874,3,2014-06-09 05:31:24,2014-06-09 13:31:24,"Typing this early Tuesday morning.  Didn't have the energy to type on Monday about Sunday night.

Earlier Saturday evening Louis and I had that bear encounter.  Yesterday morning when I went out to the Honda to load it up for the trip to the river, I noticed a little change in the seat.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hondaseat.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-875"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hondaseat.jpg"" alt=""hondaseat"" width=""800"" height=""450"" /></a>

Earlier Saturday evening Louis and I had that bear encounter.  Yesterday morning when I went out to the Honda to load it up for the trip to the river, I noticed a little change in the seat.

Park Service Ranger Kae stopped by and asked if I would like to tag along on a trip to evaluate the condition of a trail that has been closed for years.  This trail used to lead to near the head waters of the Doame River.  Years ago the Doame River emptied into the Pacific Ocean.  After a few earthquakes the river changed course and now flows into the East Alsek River, the same river that runs by my cabin.

We rode the Hondas several miles on maintained trails, then another mile or so on an overgrown seldom used trail to where it ended at the edge of the river.  Now it was time to put on chest waders and wade across to the beginning of the closed/abandoned trail.  We were not sure where the trail was but soon found the parallel ruts left by ATVs years ago.

One story I heard about why the trail was closed goes like this.  Beavers dammed up some of the tributaries of the Doame.  When their dams burst the flood ran down the ruts of the ATV trail and created new small streams.  Well the salmon started spawning in those new streams.  So to protect the salmon habitat the trail was closed.  As far as I know there is only one seldom used cabin back in there and there is an easier way to get to that cabin than on the trail anyway.  If this story is true, the salmon won and the people didn’t lose much if anything.

In some places it was impossible to follow the old trail because of fallen trees and invasive Alders.  In other places it looked like this:

This part of the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve has some pretty old growth trees.  Many of them have become draped in moss.  The wildflowers sheltered by these monarchs are beautiful.  The rain, wind and poor light didn’t lend itself to many photographs but I did snap a few.

One story I heard about why the trail was closed goes like this.  Beavers dammed up some of the tributaries of the Doame.  When their dams burst the flood ran down the ruts of the ATV trail and created new small streams.  Well the salmon started spawning in those new streams.  So to protect the salmon habitat the trail was closed.  As far as I know there is only one seldom used cabin back in there and there is an easier way to get to that cabin than on the trail anyway.  If this story is true, the salmon won and the people didn’t lose much if anything.

In some places it was impossible to follow the old trail because of fallen trees and invasive Alders.  In other places it looked like this:

This part of the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve has some pretty old growth trees.  Many of them have become draped in moss.  The wildflowers sheltered by these monarchs are beautiful.  The rain, wind and poor light didn’t lend itself to many photographs but I did snap a few.

A couple of extra events were added to this opener.  I already mentioned going afloat on the Honda when the high tide made the slough deeper than expected.  Today motoring down Muddy Creek in the skiff I ran over a submerged log.  Wildflower was holding on for dear life as the boat suddenly changed speed and direction.  Now the motor is making a strange sound when I raise or lower it.  More on this later.  Then there was the encounter with the patrolling parasitic jaegers.

These birds are nesting along side the road to the boat harbor.  When you approach them from either direction they lift off the ground like a couple of F-15s going on alert over the White House.   To them, I am  the invader (me on the Honda)  They soar up to about thirty feet then turn, radar locked on, and dive at the intruder.  One of the pair is usually coming in from straight ahead.  The other one is preforming a flanking maneuver and coming in from the rear quarter.  Of course you are focused on the one about to stab you in the forehead with its beak.  The flanking bird has designs on the back of your head.  They zoom by so close you can see the little claws on their feet.

I got the following off WIKIPEDIA:

The <b>parasitic jaeger</b>, also known as the <b>arctic skua</b> or <b>parasitic skua</b>, (<i>Stercorarius parasiticus</i>) is a <a title=""Seabird"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird"">seabird</a> in the <a title=""Skua"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skua"">skua</a> family Stercorariidae.

This species breeds in the north of <a title=""Eurasia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia"">Eurasia</a> and North America, with significant populations as far south as northern <a title=""Scotland"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"">Scotland</a>. It nests on dry <a title=""Tundra"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra"">tundra</a>, higher fells and islands, laying up to four olive-brown eggs. It is usually silent except for mewing and wailing notes while on the breeding grounds. Like other skuas, it will fly at the head of a human or fox approaching its nest. Although it cannot inflict serious damage, it is a frightening and painful experience. It is a <a title=""Bird migration"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"">migrant</a>, wintering at sea in the tropics and southern oceans.

In the <a title=""British Isles"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles"">British Isles</a>, they breed in <a title=""Shetland"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland"">Shetland</a> and <a title=""Orkney"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney"">Orkney</a>, the <a title=""Outer Hebrides"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides"">Outer Hebrides</a>, <a title=""Sutherland"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland"">Sutherland</a>, <a title=""Caithness"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caithness"">Caithness</a>, and some islands in <a title=""Argyll and Bute"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute"">Argyll</a>.

This bird will feed on rodents, small birds and insects but also robs <a title=""Gull"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull"">gulls</a> and <a title=""Tern"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern"">terns</a> of their catches. Like the larger skua <a title=""Species"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"">species</a>, it continues this piratical behaviour throughout the year, showing great agility as it harasses its victims.

Small for a skua, the parasitic jaeger measures 41–48 cm (16–19 in) in length, 107–125 cm (42–49 in) in wingspan and weighs 300–650 g (0.66–1.43 lb).<sup id=""cite_ref-2"" class=""reference""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_jaeger#cite_note-2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">[</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">]</span></a></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-CRC_3-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_jaeger#cite_note-CRC-3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">[</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">]</span></a></sup> The tail streamer of the breeding adult accounts for about 7 cm (2.8 in) of their length. Light-morph adults have a brown back, mainly white underparts and dark primary wing feathers with a white ""flash"". The head and neck are yellowish-white with a black cap and there is a pointed central tail projection. Dark-morph adults are dark brown, and intermediate-phase birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts, head and neck. All morphs have the white wing flash.

Juveniles are even more problematic, and are difficult to separate from long-tailed jaegers. They are bulkier, shorter-winged, and less tern-like than that species, but show the same wide range of plumage variation. The flight is more <a title=""Falcon"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon"">falcon</a>-like. However, they are usually warmer toned than Long-tailed, with browner shades, rather than grey.

913,3,2014-06-18 22:12:03,2014-06-19 06:12:03,"Another commercial fishing opener is over.  Wildflower said today, ""you know it has been a good opener when you are glad it's over.""  (Translation;   the weather was bad we are both exhausted but, we caught some fish and we made some money.  Now we can rest.)  Together in three days we caught over 570 fish that weighed over 3,700 pounds.

A couple of extra events were added to this opener.  I already mentioned going afloat on the Honda when the high tide made the slough deeper than expected.  Today motoring down Muddy Creek in the skiff I ran over a submerged log.  Wildflower was holding on for dear life as the boat suddenly changed speed and direction.  Now the motor is making a strange sound when I raise or lower it.  More on this later.  Then there was the encounter with the patrolling parasitic jaegers.

These birds are nesting along side the road to the boat harbor.  When you approach them from either direction they lift off the ground like a couple of F-15s going on alert over the White House.   To them, I am  the invader (me on the Honda)  They soar up to about thirty feet then turn, radar locked on, and dive at the intruder.  One of the pair is usually coming in from straight ahead.  The other one is preforming a flanking maneuver and coming in from the rear quarter.  Of course you are focused on the one about to stab you in the forehead with its beak.  The flanking bird has designs on the back of your head.  They zoom by so close you can see the little claws on their feet.

I got the following off WIKIPEDIA:

The <b>parasitic jaeger</b>, also known as the <b>arctic skua</b> or <b>parasitic skua</b>, (<i>Stercorarius parasiticus</i>) is a <a title=""Seabird"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird"">seabird</a> in the <a title=""Skua"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skua"">skua</a> family Stercorariidae.

This species breeds in the north of <a title=""Eurasia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia"">Eurasia</a> and North America, with significant populations as far south as northern <a title=""Scotland"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"">Scotland</a>. It nests on dry <a title=""Tundra"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra"">tundra</a>, higher fells and islands, laying up to four olive-brown eggs. It is usually silent except for mewing and wailing notes while on the breeding grounds. Like other skuas, it will fly at the head of a human or fox approaching its nest. Although it cannot inflict serious damage, it is a frightening and painful experience. It is a <a title=""Bird migration"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"">migrant</a>, wintering at sea in the tropics and southern oceans.

In the <a title=""British Isles"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles"">British Isles</a>, they breed in <a title=""Shetland"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland"">Shetland</a> and <a title=""Orkney"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney"">Orkney</a>, the <a title=""Outer Hebrides"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides"">Outer Hebrides</a>, <a title=""Sutherland"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland"">Sutherland</a>, <a title=""Caithness"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caithness"">Caithness</a>, and some islands in <a title=""Argyll and Bute"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute"">Argyll</a>.

This bird will feed on rodents, small birds and insects but also robs <a title=""Gull"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull"">gulls</a> and <a title=""Tern"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern"">terns</a> of their catches. Like the larger skua <a title=""Species"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"">species</a>, it continues this piratical behaviour throughout the year, showing great agility as it harasses its victims.

Small for a skua, the parasitic jaeger measures 41–48 cm (16–19 in) in length, 107–125 cm (42–49 in) in wingspan and weighs 300–650 g (0.66–1.43 lb).<sup id=""cite_ref-2"" class=""reference""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_jaeger#cite_note-2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">[</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">]</span></a></sup><sup id=""cite_ref-CRC_3-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_jaeger#cite_note-CRC-3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">[</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">]</span></a></sup> The tail streamer of the breeding adult accounts for about 7 cm (2.8 in) of their length. Light-morph adults have a brown back, mainly white underparts and dark primary wing feathers with a white ""flash"". The head and neck are yellowish-white with a black cap and there is a pointed central tail projection. Dark-morph adults are dark brown, and intermediate-phase birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts, head and neck. All morphs have the white wing flash.

Juveniles are even more problematic, and are difficult to separate from long-tailed jaegers. They are bulkier, shorter-winged, and less tern-like than that species, but show the same wide range of plumage variation. The flight is more <a title=""Falcon"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon"">falcon</a>-like. However, they are usually warmer toned than Long-tailed, with browner shades, rather than grey.

The call of these birds which is most often heard is a nasal mewing sound, repeated a few times in display, whereas its alarm call is a shorter sound.

I saw four bears yesterday.  A sow and twin cubs when I was on the way back from the river.  As I approached them on the trail she stood up to get a better view of me.  They were ion a slight knoll standing among the blooming purple Lupines.  The snow capped peaks were behind them.  It would have been a terrific photograph.  I had the camera in my pocket but by the time I got it out and turned on they were gone.  I rode the wheeler over to where they had been but the Alder brush had swallowed them up.

I saw four bears yesterday.  A sow and twin cubs when I was on the way back from the river.  As I approached them on the trail she stood up to get a better view of me.  They were ion a slight knoll standing among the blooming purple Lupines.  The snow capped peaks were behind them.  It would have been a terrific photograph.  I had the camera in my pocket but by the time I got it out and turned on they were gone.  I rode the wheeler over to where they had been but the Alder brush had swallowed them up.

Today began at five.  The commercial fishing “openers” begin on Sunday at twelve noon sharp.  The department of fish and wildlife have some formula to determine if enough fish are in the river to allow continued fishing past Monday at noon.  At nine on Monday an announcement is made over the VHF radio letting all of us know if the fishing will be extended one, two or three days.  Today there was no extension so that meant all the fishing gear had to be pulled out of the river by noon.  As I understand it, depending on the number of fishermen fishing and the number of fish being sold a determination can be made as to the health of the fishery at any point in time and if continued fishing should be allowed.  The reason for the early start on Monday is to report any fish caught overnight.  The more fish reported the more likely the opener will be extended.

Well several fishermen were not catching many fish this opener so the formula told fish and game to not extend the opener past noon today.  Last week we were allowed to fish for three days.  This week just the one.  Wildflower and I caught a couple hundred pounds of fish but nothing like the earlier catches.  A neighbor showed me a real simple way to cook the salmon.  Cut the fillets into strips one inch square.  In a plastic bag put the fish, spices or seasoning you like to use.  Shake the bag to coat the strips.  Fry the strips in a little oil.  It is so easy even I can do it.  The left over strips make a great addition to an omelet the next day

The weather yesterday and today was crummy.  A light misting rain fell most of the time.  It wasn’t too bad though since there was little or no wind.  The temperature was in the mid-50s.  But there was some fog.

As mentioned several times here, the Alsek River is fed in part by a couple of glaciers.  The water where we fish is a silvery gray due to the large amount of glacial powder suspended in it.  Frequently icebergs come down the river.  The temperature of the water is in the mid-thirties.  There are places in the river where there are whirlpools spinning trapped icebergs around and around.  Some places are very deep yet the water boils up from some unseen obstruction or maybe it is just the powerful current making the turbulence.

Looking across more than the mile width of the river this morning, there was a layer of fog about three to four feet thick starting at the surface.  We drive our boats standing up.  It was easy to see over the fog standing but you couldn’t see the water.  Was that a log?  Nope just a wave!  How about that, an iceberg?  Nope just a reflection!  Is that twig in the water attached to a submerged tree?  The fog looked like the top of a layer of clouds we have all seen as we look out the window of an airliner passes through.  The fog is interesting to watch as it caresses the water.  The fog seems to sooth the appearance of the dangerous current under it.

The black wolf trotted by again just now.  Louis saw it and was barking.  That is what got our attention.  One of the men from the fish plant was here using the internet.  He jumped on his Honda and took off after the wolf trying to get a picture.  He did get a couple of long range shots but the wolf easily kept the space between them from closing.",June 23rd,,publish,open,open,,june-23rd,,,2014-06-23 19:07:08,2014-06-24 03:07:08,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=928,0,post,,4

The article below was sent to me by a friend.  It goes into more detail than my recent post about the weather created by the Gulf of Alaska.  Please forgive the weird spacing.

One reader asked about the size of the net I use to catch mosquitoes.  I use that size because the ones it catches fry up the best.  The bigger ones are too tough.

<!--Main Text-->As summer wanes and the sun's influence on high Northern Hemisphere latitudes diminishes, the prime global breeding grounds for northern winter storms renew their vigour. One can be found in the North Atlantic Ocean between the coasts of Greenland and Iceland, the appropriately named <i>Icelandic Low</i>. The second lies in the North Pacific off the coast of Alaska between the Aleutian Islands archipelago and the southern Alaska coast. It goes by the names the <i>Aleutian Low</i> and the <i>Gulf of Alaska Low</i>. These low pressure zones are semipermanent features of the global weather map and general circulation patterns that diminish in extent and depth during the warm season and intensify during the cold months.

<center><img src=""http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/winterstorm-victoria2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""315"" border=""2"" /></center>The Aleutian Low and the eastern North Pacific High found to the south have a cyclic relationship during the course of the year which impacts the weather along the west coasts of Canada and the United States and into the northern portions of the western Cordilleran. Since this is also a prime source region for Pacific maritime air masses, the weather patterns across the continent are also affected. Within the subpolar zone, warm air moving north from the tropics and cold air moving south from the Arctic clash, a conflict that is strongest during the cold half of the year and weakest during the warm season months.

After an active winter, the Aleutian Low diminishes slightly in March and by April is sending fewer storms outward. The feature virtually disappears in July, appearing as a trough of low pressure rather than a tight low-pressure cell. As solar energy falling on the arctic regions diminishes, the Aleutian Low again strengthens in September, ready to produce a litter of winter storms.

The clash between cold and mild air generates spinning, low-pressure cells that grow to energetic youth over the Gulf of Alaska. As a result, meteorologists call the region a ""center of action"" for North Pacific maritime and coastal storms. The Aleutian Low region is characterized by barometric pressure readings of 101.3 kPa or less, high humidity, and generally complete cloud covers. When a newly born storm spins up, the region experiences strong winds and heavy precipitation, most falling as rain, despite the high latitude. By November, the Aleutian Low average surface pressure has dropped to 100.2 kPa, a level it maintains for much of the winter.

The Gulf of Alaska lies in the arched bite of the State, south of Anchorage between the Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak Island and the eastern panhandle. The northern coast of the gulf is fortressed by the Wrangell/St Elias Mountains — one of the world's highest mountain ranges which continues to grow at a geologically-hyper speed of 4 cm (1.6 inches) per year — that effectively block most storms from entering eastern Alaska and the Yukon Territory. The Gulf of Alaska is the most common entry point for the northeastern Pacific storm track that sends stormy weather to the North American coast.

<center><img src=""http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/gastorms.gif"" alt="""" width=""412"" height=""300"" border=""2"" /></center>Storms move out of the Gulf of Alaska into the Pacific Northwest region of the continent with great regularity, as many as three or four per week during the height of the winter storm season. Quite often, these storms are packed so closely that the Pacific Northwest does not experience the clearing weather break so common over the rest of the continent. I have compared this train of tempests to the roll of a nearly never-ending freight train of nearly uniform boxcars. As each storm rolls by, the clearing break is often no more than a tease, like the daylight seen between the roll of a chain of boxcars. Only rarely in some areas of the coast does a ""flat car"" appear and the ""caboose"" may not arrive until spring.

Winter Gulf of Alaska storms typically sport winds in excess of 80 km/h (50 mph) with corresponding high waves. Some storms rival the strength of the great hurricanes/typhoons and would be considered as such if their origins were tropical rather than polar. (In fact, the <i>Hurricane Hunter</i> air squadron often deploys aircraft into these storms to study their structure.) Winds as high as 160 km/h (100 mph) have been recorded with wave heights pushing 20 m (65 ft) or more. Over the years, these storms have taken their toll of fishing and merchant vessels caught in open waters.

When these storms hit the North American coast, they encounter a series of high mountain ranges parallelling the coast from central Alaska southward into California. The mountains force the storm air to great altitudes causing then to dump much of their prodigious moisture content on the coastal mountains as rain and snow. The result is the incredibly dense temperate rainforests that cover the coast from Alaska's Panhandle through British Columbia and into northern California.

<center><img src=""http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/innerpassage1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""528"" height=""338"" border=""2"" /></center>In these regions, rain and snow are measured in metres (yards) annually. During the winter, nearly all days report rain or snow somewhere in the region. The wetness sits in the region can be exemplified by Juneau, Alaska — 222 wet days annually; Prince Rupert, British Columbia — 240; Clearwater, Washington — 192; and Astoria, Oregon — 190. The world's record for snowfall in one snow year (which runs from July 1-June 30) was established on Mt Baker in Washington in 1998-99: 2986 cm (1140.0 inches). And North America's wettest year drenched Montague Island's MacLeod Harbor, about 112 km (70 miles) east of Seward, Alaska with 8440 mm (332.29 inches) in 1976.

Winter Gulf of Alaska storms typically sport winds in excess of 80 km/h (50 mph) with corresponding high waves. Some storms rival the strength of the great hurricanes/typhoons and would be considered as such if their origins were tropical rather than polar. (In fact, the <i>Hurricane Hunter</i> air squadron often deploys aircraft into these storms to study their structure.) Winds as high as 160 km/h (100 mph) have been recorded with wave heights pushing 20 m (65 ft) or more. Over the years, these storms have taken their toll of fishing and merchant vessels caught in open waters.

When these storms hit the North American coast, they encounter a series of high mountain ranges parallelling the coast from central Alaska southward into California. The mountains force the storm air to great altitudes causing then to dump much of their prodigious moisture content on the coastal mountains as rain and snow. The result is the incredibly dense temperate rainforests that cover the coast from Alaska's Panhandle through British Columbia and into northern California.

<h1 align=""Center""></h1>
<!--Main Text-->As summer wanes and the sun's influence on high Northern Hemisphere latitudes diminishes, the prime global breeding grounds for northern winter storms renew their vigour. One can be found in the North Atlantic Ocean between the coasts of Greenland and Iceland, the appropriately named <i>Icelandic Low</i>. The second lies in the North Pacific off the coast of Alaska between the Aleutian Islands archipelago and the southern Alaska coast. It goes by the names the <i>Aleutian Low</i> and the <i>Gulf of Alaska Low</i>. These low pressure zones are semipermanent features of the global weather map and general circulation patterns that diminish in extent and depth during the warm season and intensify during the cold months.

<center><img src=""http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/winterstorm-victoria2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""315"" border=""2"" /></center>The Aleutian Low and the eastern North Pacific High found to the south have a cyclic relationship during the course of the year which impacts the weather along the west coasts of Canada and the United States and into the northern portions of the western Cordilleran. Since this is also a prime source region for Pacific maritime air masses, the weather patterns across the continent are also affected. Within the subpolar zone, warm air moving north from the tropics and cold air moving south from the Arctic clash, a conflict that is strongest during the cold half of the year and weakest during the warm season months.

After an active winter, the Aleutian Low diminishes slightly in March and by April is sending fewer storms outward. The feature virtually disappears in July, appearing as a trough of low pressure rather than a tight low-pressure cell. As solar energy falling on the arctic regions diminishes, the Aleutian Low again strengthens in September, ready to produce a litter of winter storms.

The clash between cold and mild air generates spinning, low-pressure cells that grow to energetic youth over the Gulf of Alaska. As a result, meteorologists call the region a ""center of action"" for North Pacific maritime and coastal storms. The Aleutian Low region is characterized by barometric pressure readings of 101.3 kPa or less, high humidity, and generally complete cloud covers. When a newly born storm spins up, the region experiences strong winds and heavy precipitation, most falling as rain, despite the high latitude. By November, the Aleutian Low average surface pressure has dropped to 100.2 kPa, a level it maintains for much of the winter.

The Gulf of Alaska lies in the arched bite of the State, south of Anchorage between the Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak Island and the eastern panhandle. The northern coast of the gulf is fortressed by the Wrangell/St Elias Mountains — one of the world's highest mountain ranges which continues to grow at a geologically-hyper speed of 4 cm (1.6 inches) per year — that effectively block most storms from entering eastern Alaska and the Yukon Territory. The Gulf of Alaska is the most common entry point for the northeastern Pacific storm track that sends stormy weather to the North American coast.

<center><img src=""http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/gastorms.gif"" alt="""" width=""412"" height=""300"" border=""2"" /></center>Storms move out of the Gulf of Alaska into the Pacific Northwest region of the continent with great regularity, as many as three or four per week during the height of the winter storm season. Quite often, these storms are packed so closely that the Pacific Northwest does not experience the clearing weather break so common over the rest of the continent. I have compared this train of tempests to the roll of a nearly never-ending freight train of nearly uniform boxcars. As each storm rolls by, the clearing break is often no more than a tease, like the daylight seen between the roll of a chain of boxcars. Only rarely in some areas of the coast does a ""flat car"" appear and the ""caboose"" may not arrive until spring.

Winter Gulf of Alaska storms typically sport winds in excess of 80 km/h (50 mph) with corresponding high waves. Some storms rival the strength of the great hurricanes/typhoons and would be considered as such if their origins were tropical rather than polar. (In fact, the <i>Hurricane Hunter</i> air squadron often deploys aircraft into these storms to study their structure.) Winds as high as 160 km/h (100 mph) have been recorded with wave heights pushing 20 m (65 ft) or more.

During the winter, nearly all days report rain or snow somewhere in the region. The wetness sits in the region can be exemplified by Juneau, Alaska — 222 wet days annually; Prince Rupert, British Columbia — 240; Clearwater, Washington — 192; and Astoria, Oregon — 190. The world's record for snowfall in one snow year (which runs from July 1-June 30) was established on Mt Baker in Washington in 1998-99: 2986 cm (1140.0 inches).

The article below was sent to me by a friend.  It goes into more detail than my recent post about the weather created by the Gulf of Alaska.  Please forgive the weird spacing.

One reader asked about the size of the net I use to catch mosquitoes.  I use that size because the ones it catches fry up the best.  The bigger ones are too tough.

On the way to the boat I saw a beautiful wolf.  A big one with a mottled coat, shades of brown, gray and black.  It has taken you longer to read this sentence than the wolf was within sight before it disappeared into the Alders.  When I’m on the Honda I need to start looking farther down the trail to see these elusive animals sooner.

The river is about a mile wide near where we anchor the boats.  The ice coming downstream doesn’t get pushed by the current into the sheltered anchorage so I figured if there was any ice to be found it would be out where the current is strongest.  Sure enough there were some icebergs out there.  So were some trees and snags that had been washed off the banks of the river upstream.  When you find ice floating down the river you run the boat up to it then with a gaff in one hand try to keep the boat within reach of the ice and with a gaff in the other hand chop off pieces of ice small enough to lift into the boat.  While doing this the boat and ice are floating down the river together.  Remember those trees and snags?  If one doesn't keep an eye out one ends up being swept into the branches of a snag then the fun begins.  The current is so swift the boat was well below where I started out when I figured I had enough ice.

The river has been low so far this year.  This week it began to come up to the normal spring runoff levels.  That deeper water and faster current changes how the fish move and in turn where you set your nets.  What might have been a highly productive spot last week was not this week.  Of the three nets I have been fishing two were catching fish.  I moved the third net five times in the three day opener.  Last night it finally caught a couple of fish.  Two big King Salmon to be specific.  One of them weighed 25 pounds the other 30 plus a few sockeye.

It is a mystery to me how the fish move in the water of the Alsek.  It is so cloudy with glacial powder you can’t see more than a couple of inches into it.  Yet millions of fish swim up this river to spawn, following the scent of the stream where they were born.   Sometimes we will catch a single fish.  This week many of the fish caught in the net seemed to be in pairs.  In one instance I was surprised by what seemed to be an explosion in the net.  In about 15 seconds more than a dozen fish hit.  Then the rest of the afternoon nothing else came by.

Traveling back and forth from the cabin to the boat I saw several bears.  There was one sow with twin cubs along the trail from the fish plant.  The Park Ranger saw here too.  The Ranger said that bear was the biggest sow she had ever seen.  In typical mother bear fashion she ran into the bush leading her cubs.  When they are safe she will turn around and see if you are a threat.  I would like to get a picture of all this but there is something about a mother bear’s attitude that causes me to keep right on going down the trail.  One of my old Uncles told me a long time ago, “You can’t win if you try to get between mama bear and her babies”.

I kept several small Kings this week.  Tomorrow I will vacuum pack and freeze them.  I need to see if all the parts I need for the smoker are working.  The next batch of fish I keep just might get smoked if everything is in order.  Someday I would like to try canning some salmon.  No refrigeration required then.

This afternoon I tried to wash all the stinky clothes accumulated from the fishing.  The washer went through the first cycle just fine.  It refilled with water and quit.  Now most of my clothes are floating around in the tub of the washer.  If I can’t get it going in the morning I’ll dip the water out and maybe go looking for a new washing machine on-line.  Oh yeah, the older generator conked out this week too.  I may need to charter a plane to Juneau to find replacement for these things.  Louis is almost out of dog food   I could go up to Yakutat, take a commercial plane to Juneau.  Then return the same way.  I need to check on all the options. Charter directly to Juneau or go commercial.  If it is nice tomorrow and I can get my clothes dried out I will probably just put all this off except for the dog food.",July 2nd,,publish,open,open,,july-2nd-2,,,2014-07-02 19:44:00,2014-07-03 03:44:00,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=957,0,post,,1

Charter directly to Juneau or go commercial.  If it is nice tomorrow and I can get my clothes dried out I will probably just put all this off except for the dog food.",July 2nd,,inherit,open,open,,957-revision-v1,,,2014-07-02 19:44:00,2014-07-03 03:44:00,,957,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2014/07/02/957-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

Next Monday wildflower has several guests coming in for a visit.  Because of that he and I will fish separately the rest of the year.  He taught me a lot in the few weeks we fished together.  I appreciate his patience.  I had been fishing with one of his nets so I need to take one of my own over to fish with from now on this season.

There was an announcement yesterday that the East Alsek River will be open for commercial fishing Sunday at noon till Monday at noon.  The East River is the one just outside my cabin door.  I may start fishing there a little later on but this week I’ll stay on the bigger river.  If there are a lot of fish in the East River I may move over here the next week.  Fish and Game laws won’t let me fish in the two different rivers at the same time with the one permit I have.

962,3,2014-07-06 22:36:03,2014-07-07 06:36:03,"Ever have one of those days when even the simplest thing can turn into a real mess. Sure, we all have. Today a couple of really simple things went way south while I was on the river.

The first one involves resetting the little ten fathom net. The fishing was slow and I had moved one other net to a more promising spot. When you find a spot where there is an eddy in the water and the water is deep enough and there are no trees or snags on the bottom to tangle your net in a person should try setting a net there. There was just such a spot along the bank of the river just barely off the main channel. The glacier upstream was calving off very large icebergs this morning. These bergs were floating by at about 6 miles an hour just beyond where I wanted to set up in that little eddy. You probably know what you see of an iceberg is only about ten percent of the size of the beast. Some of them this morning were more than 20 feel long and were sticking out of the water three or four feet. Even a beach ball size chunk of ice can play hell with a net if it has a current pushing it along. Back to the simple thing of setting the net. First you climb up the bank of the river and set an anchor to hold the shore end of the net so the webbing is in the water. Depending on the way the net is rigged that anchor might be 20 feet from the edge of the water. Then you back the boat out into the river letting the net spill over the into the water until you get to the other anchor at the far end of the net. You hold onto the anchor pulling the net tight then throw the anchor overboard, hoping it will catch the bottom and hold the net straight. Simple. Usually. The current was so strong on the outside of the eddy the boat swung around and the propeller caught the anchor rope. It only wound around the prop two or three times before the engine quit. There I am anchored to the bottom with no engine, the stern of the boat pointed upstream toward those United Van Lines size icebergs coming down the river. I raised the outboard so the prop was out of the water but couldn't reach the wound up rope. To cut this rambling off the solution was to cut the rope, recover the anchor since it was still attached to the net and reconnect everything. Oh yeah, there were snags under the water at this eddy so I ended up pulling the net out before I got into any more trouble.

The other river episode involved the boat anchor. At night we anchor the boats out a ways from the shore for a couple of reasons. Depending on the tide you might find the boat sitting on the shore if you anchored it at high tide and went back for it at low tide. The bears are also attracted to the sent of fish assuming you caught some recently. The way around these problems it to use two anchors. The regular anchor attached to the boat is connected to another anchor, with a long rope, which is on shore out of the water. You attach this shore anchor so you can pull the boat anchor backwards so it won't catch the bottom. You put the boat anchor up on the bow and shove the boat out away from the shore. When the rope connected to the on shore anchor is all the way out it caused the anchor on the boat to fall into the water. To get the boat back in to shore just pull on the rope. and in she comes. I had to go through this three times before I got the boat anchored tonight. Either the anchor on the bow of the boat fell back into the boat or the rope on the shore anchor was tangled or I stepped on the long rope and pulled the anchor off the boat before it was ten feet out. Damn! 

The pictures I take remind me of things to write about. Most of the time the pictures speak for themselves.  I just tried to load ten pictures into this post.  I'm doing something wrong.  They all had some sort of error.  A couple of them were of Bog Orchids.  These fragrant flowers are so delicate I have to find a way to show them off.  I remember orchids from Easter and High School Proms.  Used to be the boy asked the girl and brought the orchid.  Now I guess anything goes.  I think that's a good thing.

The other pictures included a Bald Eagle watching me fish and two bears playing out in front of the cabin.  I'll try and get them to show up another day.  I can't believe its ten thirty already.  I expect having to try four times to get the boat anchored caused me to run late today.",July 6th,,publish,open,open,,962,,,2014-07-06 22:37:32,2014-07-07 06:37:32,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=962,0,post,,0

One of the places where I have been setting a net the past few weeks always produced fish.  Dozens of salmon each commercial fishing opener.  This week there were so few fish being caught we were allowed to fish just one day.  I had the same net set in the same place as in the past.  This week it caught only one fish.

That net is 20 fathoms long.  It caught only one fish.  I also have a 10 fathom net.  The one I was having trouble with yesterday.  I set it in a new place farther up the river.  That little net caught more fish than the other two 20 fathom nets combined.  Bottom line; The fishing was slow for most of us this week.  I managed to catch about 50 and one big King.

I didn't sell the King ($1.85 a pound) and kept a few of the sockeye too ($1.25 a pound).  I gave these fish to some of the people here who don't fish commercially.

I did manage to pick up a net I had left over at Wildflowers earlier in the season.  Much of the conversation between fishermen is about how high the water is getting in the Alsek river and whether one is going to move their nets from that river to the East Alsek river.  I’m going to move all my nets up to a place on the river called the elbow.  It is a little farther up the river from the harbor but with the higher water level I hope the fish are there.

This afternoon there was a meeting at the ranger station between the Dry Bay fishermen and some of the park officials.  The Chief Ranger, the District Ranger and the Dry Bay rangers were there.  The Park Superintendent was supposed to be but the bad weather kept him from flying in for the meeting.

It was just my second of these annual meetings.  Some of those present have been coming out here to Dry Bay for almost 40 years.  Those old timers can shed a lot of light on why things are the way they are.  For example:  Trail maintenance is always an issue.  Today you might question why there is a turn in the trail when going straight would make more sense.     Years ago when people first started driving jeeps and trucks out here there might have been a log that had washed in that had to be driven around.  The log is now long gone, the Willows and Alder have grown up all around where that old log was therefore the unexplained curve in the trail.

Another example of how this land is changing.  There used to be a trail that parallels the ocean.  That trail skirted the edge of the brush that grew on the land above the tide line.  The surface of the land here is rising because of tectonic activity and glacial retreating.  The higher land allows the brush to advance over the older trails.  So, as a result, we now drive on the third trail that parallels the ocean.  The first two have been swallowed up by the brush.

Since I’m shifting my nets to all new places and the river is continuing to come up I will wait till Sunday to get them ready to pull into the water.  I’m anxious to get back to the fishing.  The anticipation is addictive.  If you catch fish the feeling is satisfying.  If you don’t the anticipation doubles.  ….

I’m loving it!

971,3,2014-07-11 19:38:49,2014-07-12 03:38:49,"Things have been pretty slow here this week.  Today it has rained all day long.  The weather service calls it “Heavy at times”.  Most of us would say it was pouring.  The weather station showed one period at six tenths an inch per hour.

I did manage to pick up a net I had left over at Wildflowers earlier in the season.  Much of the conversation between fishermen is about how high the water is getting in the Alsek river and whether one is going to move their nets from that river to the East Alsek river.  I’m going to move all my nets up to a place on the river called the elbow.  It is a little farther up the river from the harbor but with the higher water level I hope the fish are there.

This afternoon there was a meeting at the ranger station between the Dry Bay fishermen and some of the park officials.  The Chief Ranger, the District Ranger and the Dry Bay rangers were there.  The Park Superintendent was supposed to be but the bad weather kept him from flying in for the meeting.

It was just my second of these annual meetings.  Some of those present have been coming out here to Dry Bay for almost 40 years.

The new weather station has provided a lot of information today.  It has rained over 2 inches so fay.  The highest rain rate was 1.09 inches per hour.  That happened shortly after midnight. The maximum temperature today was 57 the minimum was 54.  The wind has averages slightly less than 2 MPH all day.  The beach out front looks like a big lake.  It is completely covered with water...about one inch deep.  The sand is so saturated the water has no place to go till the river goes down.

The tides are adding a lot of water to the beaches and rivers too.  Tonight there will be an 11.8 foot high tide then the next low tide in the morning will be -2.9 feet.  In other words there will be a 14.7 foot change in the sea level in the next half day.  I wonder what that will do to the fishing.

We had a visitor last night.  Louis had been whining quite a bit early in the evening.  I didn’t see anything outside but this morning there was proof we had had company.  A bear dug up some roots out in the yard.  It must have been here a while because it or they left three piles of poop around where the digging had happened.

A brother-in-law is coming for a visit next week.  I got his room ready today.  Bill is fairly bald.  So am I.  I thought it was interesting in that he wrote in an email he had changed his hair style.  Now he parts it on the left.  I wrote back I had not changed mine.  I still have that wide part right down the middle.

One of the old timers said these high tides have unpredictable results on the salmon movement.  Sometimes the fish hold off in the ocean because of the rough surf.  Other times the high water just pushes them far upstream past where we are fishing.  This time tomorrow night I will know the answer for this tide anyway.

978,3,2014-07-14 21:52:15,2014-07-15 05:52:15,"Another commercial fishing opener has closed.  Like last week the fishing was slow.  Yesterday I caught 29 fish and today added 27 more to the food chain.  I kept seven.  The others weighed 255 pounds.  A month ago the average weight of each fish was about 6.5 pounds.  This week the average is a little over 5 pounds.

I commented to the Fish and Game fisheries biologist about the smaller size.  She said when the volume of fish in the river drops off like it has the last two weeks and when the size goes down that means the salmon run on the Alsek River is half over.

All the rain and the very high tides have made many of the trails difficult to travel over.  To avoid these roads covered with water I go down the beach as far as I can then cut across to connect with a regular route to the boat harbor.

To get the fish to the buyer I pull a trailer with a tote on it back and forth between the harbor, the fish buyer and the cabin.  It is important to strap the tote down on the trailer for a couple of reasons.  When crossing a stream the tote would float off if it weren’t held down.  The surface of the roads is not exactly smooth.  The tote bounces around on the trailer making a lot of noise and the strap keeps it secured and much quieter.

The Fish and Game biologist announces over the VHF radio at 9:00 on Monday morning whether the fishing opener has been extended another day or two, or if it closes at noon.  Because of the high water and a dense fog this morning I waited for the announcement before I left the cabin.

The announcement meant I had to get a move on to get to the nets, clean them of the 22,000 sticks and hopefully some fish, then load the nets into the boat by noon.

As I zoomed down the beach I could hear the tote rattling around on the trailer behind me.  When I made the turn to head toward the regular route I could still hear it back there.  For some reason about half way to the harbor I looked back to check on the trailer and tote.  There was no tote on the trailer!  The strap had worked loose.  Nothing to do but turn around and backtrack.  I got to a hill where I thought it might have fallen off.  Nope!  The beach route crosses a couple of shallow sloughs that have a dip in them.  No tote there either.  The next probable place was the creek in front of the cabin.  That would be a big problem.  A: My neighbors would have seen this happen and there would be no end to the ribbing I would get.  B: The creek was flooding and the tote floats.  I kept checking the river to be sure it wasn’t floating by, on its way to the ocean.

Alas I found the escaped tote in a spot where no neighbors saw the thing jump trailer and it was far enough from the creek to not attempt an escape by water.

At the harbor the fog was so thick one could barely see one hundred feet.  Earlier in the season the route to one of the nets was stored on the GPS.  With the GPS on I proceeded to slowly leave the comfort of a visible shoreline and almost immediately ran aground on the other side of the harbor.  The fog is so disorienting and the gray color of the Alsek glacier water makes hard for this newbie.

I finally got on track with the GPS and proceeded into the fog bank at about one quarter speed.  All the while thinking of those huge icebergs and trees coming down the river toward me out of the fog.  I would not have been able to see them till they were a hundred feet away and closing fast.  All I could hear was the engine running and the water passing under the boat.  Then there was another noise.  One of the old timers, who knows the river like the back of his hand, roared past me in his boat.  He went by at full throttle.  He threw up his hand and waved as he passed.  I waved back and increased my speed about one mile per hour as long as I could see him in front of me.  It seemed to take forever to make the two mile run across the river to the other shore.  When it came into view I was very relieved.

The strength of the water was demonstrated as I eased up that far shore.  There is a vertical earthen bank that the river’s current presses against.  A large spruce tree gave way and crashed into the water as I went by.  This tree was probably 40 feet tall.  As soon as it hit the water the current tore it from the bank and carried it away.

I lost my life jacket one day a few weeks ago.  I found it floating by one of my nets the next day.  I ALWAYS wear it when out on that big water.  Seeing that 40 foot tree swept away …….

980,3,2014-07-16 20:08:12,2014-07-17 04:08:12,"There is a delicious reason I didn’t post anything here yesterday.  

The park has a ranger who specializes in Bears and Birds.  She passes through Dry Bay most summers for a few days then moves on.  She sent me a note asking if we could work out some deal that involved me giving her some Alsek Sockeye in return she would try to provide something I wanted.  Now this woman is younger than two of my children.  So that tended to eliminate several things I might ask for right away.

I got the five fish she wanted cleaned iced down in the cooler.  She brought me the batteries I needed and some other home grown vegies from her garden.  She and her associate visited for a while than we decided to cook one of her five fish.  It was delicious.  For desert we had chocolate chips.  The bourbon we three shared added a nice bit of warmth to the evening.

Yesterday I pulled the boat out of the water since I will be gone for a few days.  If it is up on the shore there is little chance it will float away should some rope break or it sinks from too much rain water collecting in it.  The subject in that last sentence caused me go back over to the boat today.  On shore unless I prop the front of the boat up on something it tilts bow downward.  With three fishing nets in the boat and a few gallons of rain water there would be no way I could reconnect it to the Honda to put it back in the river next week.  So today I took a jack and a section of log over to the boat. Now it tilts toward the stern and any rain water can drain out.

On the way over to the harbor I saw a huge wolf.  My pal Louis is a 70 pound dog.  I believe Louis could stand under this wolf.  It was a brindle brown color.  It saw me but did not seem alarmed.  I watched this magnificent animal for ten of fifteen seconds before it trotted into some taller grass out of sight.

That trip over to the boat was squeezed into a day of smoking fish.  I hope I did it right this time.  The fish were Sockeye from the Alsek River.  The neighbors say fish from the East River smoke better because they don’t contain as much fat.  But, since there are not many fish being caught out of the East River and I had these two nice Alsek fish in the cooler I made do.  I will let you know how they came out.

A big day tomorrow.  Heading down to Juneau to stock up on things that have broken or have been consumed.  Instead of renting a car I’m renting a U-Haul truck.  That way all that bulky stuff will be secure, out of the weather and deliverable in one load to the bush plane on Sunday when I return.

Yesterday I got a call ( first time I have used a phone since late April) from the bush pilot that they might not be able to fly today because of weather.  Dang!  Now there all sorts of things to tend to.  Hotel rooms, rental truck return, etc.  However this morning it looks like the storm did not develop and maybe we can get out of here after all.  I still won't know till hear from the bush pilot but things are looking up.  When I do get the final word I need to finish unloading the truck at the airport.  Uhaul won't pick the truck up at the airport on Sunday so we need to get it back to the Uhaul barn. Then call a cab to get back out to the airport

I'm finding it interesting that being in the city is more stressful than living out there with wolves and bears and other independent old fishermen.

Waiting is another adjustment that is confusing.  One can sit and wait for the fish to swim into the net or maybe they won't.  That is no problem.  Waiting for someone in a line in to finish telling their latest joke to the cashier at the grocery store is a problem.  Waiting for your food at a restaurant is different than waiting for the water to boil for the ramen noodle concoction in the cabin.  Progress?  I guess so.

I got an email from one of the Dry Bay neighbors.  Louis is getting a lot of attention.  Two or three different people have stopped in to take him for walks or to just rub his head.  I appreciate their help.  On the big plane being chartered there is room for three cases of their favorite brew.  If I keep this up some of them will want to take care of Louis more often.



The plane will be loaded with 14 foot long pieces of metal roofing, several sheets of 4x8 sheets of plywood, about 50 2x4 boards, a big washing machine, a small freezer, a smaller fridge about three months of food, a weed eater and two fishermen plus the pilot.

988,3,2014-07-22 23:21:34,2014-07-23 07:21:34,"A lot has happened since I wrote something here last Saturday.  Our flight from Juneau to the cabin was still in doubt for Sunday.  The weather up at Dry Bay was awful.  It was raining buckets according to one of the neighbors.  The bush plane that we had chartered had two flights scheduled ahead of ours.  I had unloaded the uHaul truck by ten in the morning but didn’t know if I should turn it back in yet.  Same thing concerning the hotel room.  Finally around eleven I got a call that the plane would pick us up about twelve thirty.  The rest of the return trip went smoothly.

We got back in time to go over to the river and set three nets.  The fishing was VERY good for the fishermen who were fishing down nearer the mouth of the river.  So good that the Fish and Game department extended the opener for two days.  The fishing will at noon tomorrow, Wednesday.  Not so good for us higher up stream.  I kept thinking the fish were bound to migrate farther up but as of tonight most of them have not.  We caught about 75 so far.  Bill has kept a few of them to take back home when he leaves on Saturday.  We clean the fish down at the creek in front of the cabin.  The eagles and gulls have figured out when we go down there and stop there might soon be some tasty fish parts floating down in the current.  It is quite amusing to watch the literal pecking order of the young gulls who are at the bottom of the order.  Then the adult gulls have to defer to the young eagles then in turn the mature eagles.  Those mature eagles can choose to go after the fish or one of the gulls.  Just like on TV.

Tonight I moved one of the nets down to where the fish have been holding.  I hope my doing that doesn’t scare the fish away from all the other nets.  A couple of the old timers who have the prime spots have caught upwards of six hundred fish since Sunday at noon.

Bill wanted me to mention here how humble and good he is.  So the next sentence is dedicated to him.  Bill is _______________________.

The storage side of the cabin is cramped right now.  There are several totes of food purchased in Juneau that I have not had time to unpack and store because of the fishing.  Maybe tomorrow afternoon I can get that done.  

There are a couple of places I want show Bill before he leaves.  One is where some of the sockeye spawn.  It is a beautiful spot and we are likely to see some bears up there too.

The weather up at Dry Bay was awful.  It was raining buckets according to one of the neighbors.  The bush plane that we had chartered had two flights scheduled ahead of ours.  I had unloaded the uHaul truck by ten in the morning but didn’t know if I should turn it back in yet.  Same thing concerning the hotel room.  Finally around eleven I got a call that the plane would pick us up about twelve thirty.  The rest of the return trip went smoothly.

We got back in time to go over to the river and set three nets.  The fishing was VERY good for the fishermen who were fishing down nearer the mouth of the river.  So good that the Fish and Game department extended the opener for two days.  The fishing will at noon tomorrow, Wednesday.  Not so good for us higher up stream.  I kept thinking the fish were bound to migrate farther up but as of tonight most of them have not.  We caught about 75 so far.  Bill has kept a few of them to take back home when he leaves on Saturday.  We clean the fish down at the creek in front of the cabin.  The eagles and gulls have figured out when we go down there and stop there might soon be some tasty fish parts floating down in the current.  It is quite amusing to watch the literal pecking order of the young gulls who are at the bottom of the order.  Then the adult gulls have to defer to the young eagles then in turn the mature eagles.  Those mature eagles can choose to go after the fish or one of the gulls.  Just like on TV.

991,3,2014-07-23 20:52:46,2014-07-24 04:52:46,"A full day of Alaska life unfolded for us today.  We got out on the river around nine this morning.  The 10 fathom net was checked first.  It had 6 big sockeye in it.  The second net was a disappointment.  There had been several salmon in the net but the seals got everyone.  All they left were a few fins and unrecognizable parts.  The third net, old faithful, had over 20 fish in it.  The seals had been there too but only a couple of the fish were damaged.

Bill wanted to keep a few more fish.  He filleted a some  more to freeze and prepared the rest for smoking.  We will probably do that tomorrow.

This afternoon we went up near the headwaters of the East Alsek River to see if the sockeye had started spawning.  The water up there is so clear you can’t perceive how deep it is.  There was a slight breeze and the water sparkled like crystal.  These fish turn a crimson red when they are ready to spawn.  There weren’t many but those we saw swimming in this shimmering water looked like rubies in a stream of diamonds.  Most people will never have the chance to see this much natural beauty much less stand in it as we were.

There is a spot downstream where the fish tend to congregate before heading up to spawn.  Steve’s island is about two city blocks in size.  To get to the fish you have to walk half way around Steve’s island.  Today as we approached the island there was a bear watching us.  It disappeared into the brush on the island.  Later we saw two more bears from the spot where we were fishing.  None of them caused us any problems.

Bill hooked a frisky sockeye but it soon shook the hook and got away.  This week is Bill’s first visit to Dry Bay.  Since Sunday most of our time was spent on commercial fishing or preparing fish for him to take home.  This afternoon we finally got to change our pace.  The things we did and the things we saw are what most outdoors people only get to read about or watch on TV. .I think he got a glimpse of how special this place is today.

Bill is scheduled to leave for Yakutat in about an hour.  I believe he has enjoyed his trip.  Yesterday afternoon we went up the river and he caught his first Sockeye with his fly rod.  It was a large male.  It probably weighed a little over seven pounds.

We had been up there the previous two afternoons.  The first day we saw three grizzlies.  The next day we saw four.  I recognized two of the bears.  They were the ones out in front of the cabin about ten days ago.  I hope to post pictures again soon.  I have the technical support team for Notes From Alaska working on the problem.

The old timers predict this next commercial opener will be a good one then we can expect the number of fish in the river to fall off dramatically.  When that happens they will either move their boats and gear over here to the East River or move on to another fishery.

Last night we had dinner at a neighbor’s house.  Lamb, boiled potatoes and gravy, homemade bread. Sweet corn on the cob and a special concoction of Brussel sprouts, bacon bits, brown sugar and raisins.  I took brownies.  By following the directions on the box I managed to cook them too long.  I suggested we use the table saw to cut the brownies into serving sizes but we found a cleaver and used it instead.

It must have been Thursday morning when we had another earthquake wake us up.  This 5.9 one was preceded by a rumbling that sounded like distant thunder.  Then there was a noticeable jolt that was followed by several seconds of swaying.  Things hanging inside the cabin were swinging back and forth several inches.  These earthquakes cause my adrenalin pump to awaken.  There is nothing to do but wait and see if the movement gets worse.  If the earth did start to shake more I would open the valve that the adrenalin flows through and get moving.  But this quake was like the last one.  Just some plates moving six miles below the surface.

Setting the first two nets was not a problem in that I had already decided where they should be.  The third net was a problem.  I couldn’t find the eddy Wildflower suggested.  One place over at Seagull Island looked promising.  I set the third net there.  This set is right at the edge of the main river’s current.  To pull the net tight the boat ended up in that current and was swept downstream.  I couldn’t get the net perpendicular to the shore because of the current.  So I just left it at an angle.

Checking the first net there were five or six salmon in it.  The second net had three and the third net had a tree in it.  A tree the size of those tall ones Home Depot sells in the fall.  There were no fish accompanying the tree so I pulled the net and started looking for another spot.

Net number one was about three miles up the river from net number two.  I found a spot in between for the third net.

To wind this up, I ended up with 29 fish this afternoon.  They weighed a little over 150 pounds.  The location of the third net looks promising.  In a little over an hour it had five big fish in it and it is the short, 10 fathom, net.

Rather than drive all the way home then back to the river I just anchor the boat near one of the nets and wait.  This afternoon an otter came loping down the beach and stopped at the end of the net I was watching.  I did my best anti-otter scream and rattled some stuff in the bottom of the boat.  The otter hurried away but I bet I have a few fish in that net in the morning with pieces missing.

On the way home there was a grizzly in the road but it ran into the bushes as I approached.  Other than a few hundred seagulls and a dozen or so Bald Eagles that is all the wildlife I saw today.

I’m anxious for morning to see how the nets do overnight.  I’ll report back soon.

1006,3,2014-07-29 15:13:21,2014-07-29 23:13:21,"The opener must have been pretty good for some of the fishermen.  Alaska Fish and Game announced a two day extension.  That means we can fish until noon tomorrow.  I caught 60 fish in the first 24 hours.  This week seems to be running about 20% ahead of last week.

Some of the fisherman are having major problems with bears and seals stealing their fish.  I heard third hand that one team figured they were losing 50% of their catch to seals.  That might mean that half the fish are damaged by the critters not completely taken from the net.  The damaged fish, also called seconds, sell for just $0.86 a pound.  An undamaged sockeye is selling this week for $1.25 a pound.

My nets have seen some thief activity too.  Upstream the seals and otters are making off with about 10% of my fish.  The net set down near the harbor has its own bear to deal with.  Yesterday morning Wildflower saw it eating a fish out of the shore end of the net.  Later yesterday he saw the same bear swim across the lagoon to the outside end of the net.  The water is shallow there.  The bear stood up on his hind legs and proceeded to walk toward the other end of the net looking for fish.  I had picked the fish out of that net a short while earlier so the bear did no damage.  Last night about 9:30 another fisherman watched the same bear watch my net.  A fish got tangled in the net and was splashing.  The bear didn’t swim to the net this time.  It ran about three hundred yards around the end of the lagoon to the net.  The fish had stopped splashing.  Mark said it then started playing with the orange buoy that marks the shore end.  This morning that net which usually had 8 to 10 fish in it had the front half of one fish!  That net is now several miles away in another spot.

I had visits from both park rangers yesterday.  Jim came by just as I was getting ready to go back to the river.  Kae stopped in after I got back.  While she was here a sow grizzly with twin cubs walked past the front of the cabin.

Some of the fishermen are talking about moving their operations over here to the East Alsek River.  I think they are getting frustrated with all the losses to seals and bears.  If Wildflower does that I might put a net in his hot spot and just sit on it to keep the bear away.  I’ll see how he does there this week and if he moves to the East or not.

Rather than sell the seconds for eighty six cents I am bring them home, fillet them and vacuum packing them to eat later.  Some of them might even make it back to Colorado.  My new five cubic foot freezer has about two and one half cubic feet of King and Sockeye salmon in it already.  I might have to back off on the Grape Nuts and start eating some salmon soon.

I had visits from both park rangers yesterday.  Jim came by just as I was getting ready to go back to the river.  Kae stopped in after I got back.  While she was here a sow grizzly with twin cubs walked past the front of the cabin.

Some of the fishermen are talking about moving their operations over here to the East Alsek River.  I think they are getting frustrated with all the losses to seals and bears.  If Wildflower does that I might put a net in his hot spot and just sit on it to keep the bear away.  I’ll see how he does there this week and if he moves to the East or not.

Rather than sell the seconds for eighty six cents I am bring them home, fillet them and vacuum packing them to eat later.  Some of them might even make it back to Colorado.  My new five cubic foot freezer has about two and one half cubic feet of King and Sockeye salmon in it already.  I might have to back off on the Grape Nuts and start eating some salmon soon.

It has been a couple of days since anything exceptional happened here except:

Wildflower didn’t fish on Wednesday so I put a single net where he always catches fish.  That spot produced 41 fish in about four and a half hours.  I had pulled the nets from the spots I had been fishing and only had the one net in the water.  The bears and seals had been robbing all the nets set near the harbor.  With only the one net out I either sat in the shore watching it or sat in the boat doing the same thing.  The seals are so sneaky.  While I was pulling fish out of one end of the net a seal swam, unseen, from far away and grabbed a salmon out of the other end of the net.

A mother Merganser swam by followed by her clutch of seven little fuzz balls following.  Every few yards one of the little ones would break rank and swim ahead of the others to grab a bug off the surface of the river then fall back in line behind mom.

Thursday morning I went back over to the harbor to clean the boat.  Part of that trail goes through a grassy area where the Willows and Alder have not started to grow.  The black wolf that has been mentioned here before was sitting out there looking at me.  I tried to get the Honda stopped without making too much noise.  I fumbled around trying to get my pocket camera out before it disappeared.  To my surprise it got up and trotted right toward me.  I got several great pictures.  It closed to within about 50 feet then started to circle around behind me.  I stepped off the Honda and clapped my hands to scare it away.  By now it was going away from me but in no hurry.  Running toward it did speed it up a little but I bet that wolf was thinking “what a joke that thing on two legs could never catch me.”  It was right of course but it better learn to be more wary of two legged things.  

Back in April, when we were in Haines, Wildflower went by the lumber yard and got an estimate for the materials required to put a metal roof on his cabin.  The materials finally arrived so Thursday afternoon we began getting the roof ready to receive the new metal.  Friday morning the serious crew showed up (read younger more nimble men) and the new metal roof went up.  No problems as far as I know.  I bailed out after lunch since he had plenty of help.  Funny how some more help showed up at lunch time.

Thursday and again yesterday there were some Sandhill Cranes out front.  Those birds are probably the first of thousands that will begin moving through in the next weeks.  The last of the Hummingbirds headed south this week.  The feeder that had been the busiest place around here a few weeks ago is now a lonely fixture hanging outside the window.  I need to bring it in but that would be my first physical acknowledgment that the summer is fading into fall.  Just like last year I feel myself saying “say it isn’t so”.

The park ranger, Kae, and I have joined forces to process some of the sockeye that found their way into the nets.  We smoked several using different techniques.  I cover the fillets with salt and let them sit for about half an hour then smoke them.  Her recipe has them in a salt brine for 24 to 36 hours before they are smoked.  We have also tried canning some of the salmon.  The first batch of those fish we smoked for an hour.  As this is being typed the second batch are being smoked for a little over two hours.  The canned fish are delicious.  We added different spices to some of the pint jars of fish to see how they would taste.  I’m betting the Mesquite will be the best.  Kae, I think, is undecided because the Lemon Pepper or Wasabi might be good too.  I don’t know what Wasabi is so I just ruled it out.

Kae regularly patrols all the trails here in the preserve.  She had mentioned she was going up a new trail up toward Alsek Lake today.  The Alsek River flows into and out of the lake but the lake is the terminal end of a couple of huge glaciers.  This year the outlet of the lake is clogged with icebergs.  Rafters have to find their way through some side channels to avoid having to carry their gear around the ice jam.  I asked if I could tag along.  I had never been up river that far.  Never have I seen anything like the number of cabin size bergs being swept out of the lake.  There are several rapids a mile or so downstream.  Those huge icebergs would run aground in the shallow water of the rapids.  They sounded like someone moving boxes in the third floor attic of an old house while you sat listening downstairs on the first floor.  The sound seemed to come from some deep and enormous source, not a specific spot.  The water was muffling the sound of tens of thousands of pounds of ice crashing into a submerged rock.  Those huge chunks of ice would falter on their way down the river.  They would rise partially out of the water as that relentless force pushed them over the rock.  Once clear they would settle back into their high speed transition from old glacier ice to just plain water on their way to the sea.

If Kae reads this, I hope those words above give her some idea of how amazing this afternoon was for me.

1013,3,2014-08-04 23:34:34,2014-08-05 07:34:34,"That’s why they call it fishing not catching.  That line is so old that I didn’t even hear someone utter it today.  Last week Wildflower took the last half day of the opener off.  He said it would be OK if I put a net in the spot where he always catches fish right there at the edge of the harbor.  I took him up on it and in four hours caught 41 sockeye not counting all those the seals stole.

Yesterday afternoon in that same spot I caught six fish in five hours.  I pulled the net last night because the bears have been raiding nets that are left out overnight.  By eight this morning the net was back in the water.  Fishing opener closed at noon.  At ten this morning there were five more fish in the tote.  For some reason at eleven things started to improve.  I finished the one day opener with nineteen fish.  Not too bad considering others didn’t do as well and their nets were well up river.

The East Alsek River which is just outside the cabin door has a three day opener this week.  Fishing has been a little better over here so I moved the boat and all my gear back to this side of Dry Bay.  In the morning I will set a net about a half mile from my front door.  Fishing this much smaller and shallower river is a lot different than the Alsek.  The water can be crystal clear.  There is moss growing on the bottom.  That moss breaks loose and winds up in the webbing of the nets.  It can get so bad that the only way to get the moss out of the net is to pull it to shore (it will be too heavy to lift into the boat), and clean it out standing on dry ground.  Most nets don’t catch many fish when they are out of the water.  The solution is to almost constantly move back and forth across the net shaking the moss out before it completely clogs.

The results are in on the seasoned canned salmon.  We put three different spices on top of the salmon we canned a few nights ago.  I thought the Mesquite would taste the best.  Kae, I think, would have preferred one of the others.  It turns out they all tasted the same.  What we decided they should have as a spice is salt.  The time to add flavoring is after you open the canned fish and plan to serve it.  Maybe some of the more experienced canners out there will have a suggestion.

The nineteen fish did not get sold.  I brought them all home and will either smoke them or freeze the fillets to bring back to Colorado in the fall.  I have been reminded recently that some of the Bourbon deliveries made earlier came with a catch!  No pun intended. The recent conversation here about preserving all these Salmon must have reminded my suppliers how good these fish taste when all you have to do is buy a guy a drink!

Yesterday morning is a mystery to me.  Can't seem to remember just what happened.  On yeah, I do remember a little of it now.  Two days ago, Monday, I fished on the Alsek.  I kept the 19 fish and either canned or froze most of them.  Pulled the boat and moved all the gear, nets etc. over to my cabin on the East River.  Yesterday morning Louis and I walked to the river to see how things looked.  Some of the other fishermen were also there just checking things out.  Nobody had caught anything.  

I decided to try my luck yesterday afternoon anyway.  The east river is so shallow it is difficult to use the outboard on the boat.  I ended up pulling the net across the river by hand.  The shoreline tapers back from this river at a very shallow angle.  At low tide the river might be only a couple of hundred feet wide.  When the tide comes in the water advances across the shallow slope of the shore at about the speed of a slow walk.  So, when I set the net it was at the edge of the water.  As the tide came in it appeared to be near the middle of the river.  That turned out to be a good thing.  The incoming salmon were swimming in the middle of the river.  I caught over four hundred pounds yesterday afternoon.  Most of the fish were sockeye.  There were a couple of Pink salmon as well as Coho and Chum salmon.  There is a market for the Coho and Chum but not for the Pinks.  The two I caught I threw back into the river.  One of them was in poor shape.  As it floated near the surface a Bald Eagle swooped down and grabbed it.

The fish must have weighed near the payload limit of that eagle.  It's wings were slapping the water as it carried the fish toward shore.  The bird headed for a slight knoll back about three hundred yards from the river.  It managed to gain about three feet in altitude in that distance.  At the knoll it dropped down and proceeded to eat the fish.  After a while it took off.  I guess it is easier to fly with the fish in your stomach than between your feet.

Got home a little after ten last night after selling the fish.  

Today I'm smoking the remainder of Monday's fish.  Doing something a little different this time.  Brown sugar is mentioned in several of the recipes I have heard about.  So in addition to the salt this batch has brown sugar on it to.  It will be interesting to see how that tastes.

The little display said “it’s raining cats and dogs”.  I wonder how many corporate meetings it took to allow that bit of humor to leave the factory.  The other thing the weather station told me was for a brief period that morning it was raining 3.86 inches an hour.  That’s what woke me up. It sounded like a fire hose was directed at the roof.

There will be big tides the next two nights.  A 10 footer tonight and an 11.4 foot high tide tomorrow night.  I might have to do a little beachcombing these next two mornings to see if anything interesting washes in.

Today Louis helped me start on the wood shed I want to build.  It will be 8 feet deep and 15 feet long.  Logs from the beach will rest on pressure treated blocks for the foundation.  Lumber from Juneau will be the frame and other Home Depot material will be used for the roof.

Louis proved his nose still works well this evening.  He started barking here inside the cabin.  Looked out and there was a bear about three hundred yards away.  The bear started to run into the river when Louis went outside.  The old pal of mine didn’t run after the bear.  He just sat in the yard and barked at it.

When the chores and fishing can be pushed to aside for a while this place with all the natural beauty can be almost overwhelming.  The subtle signals nature is beginning to give are reminding me that fall is not far off.  I’m beginning to see family groups of birds that were not here a week ago.  The color in the meadows is changing from the vibrant shades of blooming flowers to the muted hues of seed pods and dried stems.  Some of the fishermen have already left.  Others have plans to move on to more productive waters or to jobs the changing season provides.  A few visitors are still showing up.  These “outsiders” disrupt the routine this small community tends to fall into.  Or maybe it is just me.  Leaving this simple life is still weeks away but I am homesick for this place now.

Louis just woofed.  I looked out front and the grizzly is back down there at the creek.  Until this week when I would get up during the night it never was really dark.  Now at two or three in the morning it is dark outside.  Our Mother is still at it.   Tilting our part of this globe away from the sun a little more each day.  By the end of this week it will be the seventieth time I have seen that happen.  You’d think one would be used to all this life throws at him by now.  I’m not used to it.  I’m loving it!

Louis and I spent the morning taking a walk, doing laundry and skipping breakfast.  I made up for it by drinking lots of coffee.  This afternoon wildflower came by for a short visit.  Then I went over to a neighbor’s place to can some salmon have a bite to eat and watch part of a movie.  I had a nice visit there.

When I got back to my place there was a package inside the door and an envelope on top.  The package contained some appreciated libations and a couple of pounds of mixed nuts.  The envelope contained a note of condolences.  I wondered what I had missed.  I don’t get a newspaper here but I do follow the news on the internet, biased as it can be.  Who would bother to send me a note of condolences when I have been going on about how lucky I am to be in such a beautiful place with some beautiful people and a faithful old pal like Louis?

Then I kept reading.  The note said “CONDOLENCES ON THE PASSING (are you ready for this?) ON THE PASSING OF YOUR YOUTHFULNESS.

My younger sister sent that to me.  Here I am turning another page, opening a major decade of my life.  The decade when one might notice the days are in fact going by much faster than they used to.  Fall days.  Days that signal the approach of one’s cold winter.  Days when a little comfort and love would be appreciated.

Louis and I spent the morning taking a walk, doing laundry and skipping breakfast.  I made up for it by drinking lots of coffee.  This afternoon wildflower came by for a short visit.  Then I went over to a neighbor’s place to can some salmon have a bite to eat and watch part of a movie.  I had a nice visit there.

When I got back to my place there was a package inside the door and an envelope on top.  The package contained some appreciated libations and a couple of pounds of mixed nuts.  The envelope contained a note of condolences.  I wondered what I had missed.  I don’t get a newspaper here but I do follow the news on the internet, biased as it can be.  Who would bother to send me a note of condolences when I have been going on about how lucky I am to be in such a beautiful place with some beautiful people and a faithful old pal like Louis?

Then I kept reading.  The note said “CONDOLENCES ON THE PASSING (are you ready for this?) ON THE PASSING OF YOUR YOUTHFULNESS.

My younger sister sent that to me.  Here I am turning another page, opening a major decade of my life.  The decade when one might notice the days are in fact going by much faster than they used to.  Fall days.  Days that signal the approach of one’s cold winter.  Days when a little comfort and love would be appreciated.

The card also had a gravestone on the front that had been stuck in a cake.  The stone had RIP on it.  She probably thinks that means “Remember I’m Prettiest”.

The tides this week are very high. Monday through till Saturday all the high tides are around eleven feet. With that much water the fish don't have any problem avoiding the nets.  I caught six in the new location and those fishermen who always catch their fair share didn't do much better.  Today I brought the net home.  I left the boat on the water just on case but commercial fishing might be over for me this year.

A neighbor gave me a couple pounds of bacon this morning. He thought Louis would enjoy it. When he left, Louis and I had a talk. If I would fry it I could have some. Because there was so much of it I cut a lot of the fat off. I put that fat on the stove where it proceeded to fill the area around the cabin with that delicious aroma of cooked bacon. Now I wonder how many bears are headed this way.

A while back the wildflowers were everywhere.  The first picture has at least five kinds of blooming plants in it.  The next two pictures are of the black wolf that approached.  I haven't seen this wolf since that day.  The first shot is as he came off the knoll toward me and the second is when he was alongside the honda about 50 feet away. The last picture was taken the day Ranger Kae let me tag along on the trail up toward the glacier fed Alsek Lake. Those are icebergs blocking the channel out of the lake in the distance.  The river here is about a half mile wide and very VERY swift.

The plane shows up just in time for me to head back home when the tide was at its peak. About a third of the way back I ran into a neighbor on the trail. He just shook his head and said there was no way I could get to the cabin. He said the wind was blowing about 45 off the ocean and pushing lots of water up the river and creeks.

At one point this month it was raining at a rate of 5.7 inches an hour.  When it rains that hard it is like being in one of those automatic car washes.  The water seems driven not just falling out of the sky.

Park Ranger Kae told me there are impassable places on the trails that have never been impassable before.  I believe that because twice in the past few days I have had to leave the honda on the other side of Dog Salmon creek and wade back to the cabin.

Progress is being made on the wood storage shed.  All the wooden logs or poles I need are all off the beach.  The long ones I need are all over 21 feet long.  When I tie one or two of them on the back of the honda the weight cause the front wheels to barely touch the ground.  It is hard to steer that way.  So when I get to the flooded creek I just leave the machine with its load parked above the flood line and wade home.  At the next low tide I bring go back and bring everything across.

Haven't seen much wildlife except for gathering geese and ravens.  It seems the geese must be getting into shape for their long migrations.  The skeins are getting larger as various family groups join.  The ravens are another sign that fall is creeping in.  I don't know what brings them down here to the coast this time of year.  Maybe it is the salmon that have died after spawning.  I didn't see them but the tracks prove two moose walked up the drive to the cabin sometime during the night.  Some day, zooming along on the wheeler, I expect to come around a corner and be met by one of these big critters.  They like to walk on the trails.  I hear a moose can be rather stubborn and reluctant to enter the dense brush.  Could be interesting when that happens.

The fish buyer has decided there are not enough fishermen and not enough fish being caught to go to the expense of sending people and planes down here this week.  That probably means the commercial fishing is over at Dry Bay this year.  If there is a big Silver Salmon run that could change but I will probably pack all that gear away this next week.=",August 16th,,publish,open,open,,august-16th-2,,,2014-08-16 18:53:41,2014-08-17 02:53:41,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=1039,0,post,,4

1042,3,2014-08-19 21:05:02,2014-08-20 05:05:02,"It has been eleven days since we had a day with no rain.  During that time it rained over 15 inches here at the cabin.  Even though the last few tides have been average or below the rivers and creeks are still swollen with the runoff.  In the last post here I mentioned how the trails had more water in and on them than ever before.  Well I should have gone on to say that was the case since I have been here.  Now that that is cleared up here is what happened this sunny day.

Being rather despondent over not being able to find any glass fishing floats this year I thought I should try a different tactic.  The place where most are found is being frequently patrolled by the people who live closer to the spot than me.  Since I don’t want to get up before dawn to ride several miles down the beach I decided to search on the other side of the East River.  To get to the other side requires crossing it.  Remember the remark about swollen streams?

Earlier this year I found a spot to cross the river where the water was fairly shallow.  One had to float the Honda for only a few yards to cross there.  Because of the high water I waded across without the machine just to check the depth.  At one point I had to stand on my tip toes to keep the water from filling my chest waders.  I made it across thought and thought if I waited an hour or so the water would recede enough for me to cross.

So an hour later I drive the machine off into the water.  I have been mentioning floating these four wheelers across deep places for a couple of years now.  Well, if the water is deep enough they will float but barely.  I got the beast across OK but the water managed to fill every orifice on the thing.  After pushing it up the river bank and draining the water out of the engine it started right back up.

The search down the beach produced a couple of glass floats, some buoys I can use on my nets and a desire to go back down the beach again and search a little harder this time.  Because of the high water I just left the Honda on the other side of the river.  Tomorrow or the next day, if the water goes down enough, I will wade back across and bring it home.  Bring it home after I look for glass floats again.

As I motor down the beach I have noticed how the birds glide along beside me effortlessly.  They set their wings and slip through the air like kites, with no strings attached.  They are a few feet above the sand dunes that parallel the surf.  Sometimes I feel they look over at me discussed with all the noise I am making.  If they had thumbs they would probably thumb their noses at me.  Eagles, Ravens and Gulls all do this.  I think the breeze off the ocean rushing up the face of the dunes provide the lift they need to act like kites.

1043,3,2014-08-19 21:05:02,2014-08-20 05:05:02,"It has been eleven days since we had a day with no rain.  During that time it rained over 15 inches here at the cabin.  Even though the last few tides have been average or below the rivers and creeks are still swollen with the runoff.  In the last post here I mentioned how the trails had more water in and on them than ever before.  Well I should have gone on to say that was the case since I have been here.  Now that that is cleared up here is what happened this sunny day.

Being rather despondent over not being able to find any glass fishing floats this year I thought I should try a different tactic.  The place where most are found is being frequently patrolled by the people who live closer to the spot than me.  Since I don’t want to get up before dawn to ride several miles down the beach I decided to search on the other side of the East River.  To get to the other side requires crossing it.  Remember the remark about swollen streams?

Earlier this year I found a spot to cross the river where the water was fairly shallow.  One had to float the Honda for only a few yards to cross there.  Because of the high water I waded across without the machine just to check the depth.  At one point I had to stand on my tip toes to keep the water from filling my chest waders.  I made it across thought and thought if I waited an hour or so the water would recede enough for me to cross.

So an hour later I drive the machine off into the water.  I have been mentioning floating these four wheelers across deep places for a couple of years now.  Well, if the water is deep enough they will float but barely.  I got the beast across OK but the water managed to fill every orifice on the thing.  After pushing it up the river bank and draining the water out of the engine it started right back up.

Fall is in the air here at Dry Bay.  Mount Fairweather (15,330 ft.) dominates the southeastern horizon.  The snow line is down around 8,000 feet now.  A few weeks ago it never got really dark at night.  This week the stars are making the light outside in the wee hours of the morning.  A couple of days ago a single swan was flying overhead.  It won't be long before flocks of those majestic birds will gather together here then head south.  There are a couple of sloughs where they congregate this time of year.  They are wary birds but maybe I can get a few pictures before they leave.

The Coho or Silver salmon are beginning to appear in the river.  The greatest numbers will be next month.  I caught one small Silver this evening after dinner.  Tomorrow the decision will be made about setting nets one more time.  I get the feeling there won’t be any more commercial fishing this year unless tonight’s tide fills the river with fish.

The wood shed is coming along.  I got the posts all plumbed today and about two thirds of the floor down.  I use the same arm to pound the nails as I use to cast the fly rod.  That arm is pretty worn out tonight.

It is different now though because the fish buyer isn’t down here at Dry Bay any more this season.  There just haven’t been enough fish being caught to make it worthwhile to have people and aircraft flying back and forth to Yakutat.

Four of the fishermen thought there might be a way to make a little more money this year and made their own arrangements to have what they caught flown out today.  The Silver Salmon should begin to be in the river in good numbers by now.  The timing of today’s tide was right to catch any new fish coming up the river.  The bush pilot brought some sport fishermen down for the day.  When he returned to pick those fishermen up he was going to haul the commercial fishermen’s catch back to Yakutat too.

That all went according to plan except for the fish.  There were very few fish to be caught.  When the plane left with the sport fishermen, the commercial fishermen only had to load 42 fish.

My cabin is located closest to where they were fishing.  This afternoon, while waiting for the plane, the four fishermen and both Park Rangers showed up.  The regular population of Dry Bay right now is ten people.  For a while today seven of them were in my cabin.  I ran out of chairs.  There were some left over pancakes and enough of this morning’s coffee to satisfy my hosting obligations.  It had rained steadily most of the day.  Sometimes there are tensions between the fishermen and the Rangers who have to enforce the park rules.  Today none of that was apparent as we shared this warm, dry cabin.

One of the Rangers had a bear encounter today.  There is a grizzly up at Steve’s island that has learned fishermen sometimes have fish that can be stolen.  That bear didn’t steal anything today but was aggressive enough to cause the bear spray to come unholstered.

My neighbor, the Vet., is an avid fisherman.  He has a dog named Benni.  Benni is a pointer.  Benni can be seen running for all he is worth across the beaches in search of something to point at.  You might see him “on point” at a sea gull.  His instincts are such that any bird might be worth pointing at.  Benni is all bird dog.  He is not a bear dog.  On two occasions this year he has challenged a bear.  Both times when the bear didn’t run away Benni did run. Right back to the Vet.  Now something running away from a grizzly bear is an invitation to the bear to chase it.  A fly rod is not very comforting protection when an angry bear is interested in the dog standing between your legs.

This morning the Vet. let Benni outside, left the door open and laid back down.  A little while later The Vet. Thought he heard Benni come back inside.  He opened one eye and it was not Benni.  An otter had walked into the bedroom.  After shooing the otter away the Vet. noticed Benni hiding in his bed.  The Vet’s bed.

I just looked outside.  It is foggy and still raining.  The Vet. is out front in the river fishing.  Benni is sitting on the shore watching for birds.  All is well here at Dry Bay.

Found another glass float. Louis chased a bear.  The wood shed is almost done.  Floated about four miles on an Alsek River slough in a kayak.  Changed the oil in the drowned Honda.  Didn’t catch any fish with my fly rod.  Said good bye to Wildflower and Mark for the season.

With the roof now on the wood shed I have begun to scout the beach for logs to cut and split to for fire wood.  One of the places where a lot of the logs float in is also a good place to beach comb.  That is where I found the glass float.  This one is dark green and has mold marks on it that match another float that I found last year.  On the way home a grizzly was coming down the beach.  I shut the Honda down as just watched as it approached.  It must have caught my scent because it turned away.

One of the remaining commercial fishermen had his net in the water for two tide cycles this week.  The two sets didn’t catch 30 fish total.  The scuttlebutt is that the silver salmon will show up in the river any day now.  There are several of us watching the water closely for any sign of the expected return of the salmon but as of yesterday that hadn’t happened.  Maybe this next tide will bring them in.  In the movie “Dances with Wolves” the Indians are waiting for the buffalo (Katonka) to return.  You could see the concern on the tribe’s faces because they depend on the annual appearance of the buffalo for their winter food supply.  Kevin Costner discovers the buffalo and is suddenly a hero to the Indians.  So the few of us left here at Dry Bay will keep our lonely vigil.  We will keep each other informed as to where so and so caught one two nights ago.  All the while not looking at each other but watching the water for any sign of a fish.

It has been two nights ago on our walk that Louis saw the bear I had seen earlier in the day.  He made me proud as he went after the bear.  The bear played its part perfectly and rushed off into the brush.  Louis looks so happy when he comes back to me after he has shown these bigger critters who is boss around our cabin.

One of the neighbors has an inflatable kayak.  This boat was built for serious river water.  There are multiple air chambers.  The material is very tough.  It is self-bailing.  The neighbor bought the kayak at the water’s edge from a person who had just floated the Alsek River all the way down from Canada.  We launched the boat from a take-out point the river rafters sometimes use and had planned to float the four miles downstream to where we had left a Honda earlier.

Well…. The reason most rafters don’t use the take-out where we put in is because the water is about ankle deep.  We alternated floating and pulling the kayak for the first mile.  When the slough opened up enough for us to not drag bottom the tide had started coming in so we paddled against the current the rest of the way.  This morning my shoulders are reminding me that something out of the ordinary happened yesterday.

Two of the old timer fishermen left for the season yesterday afternoon.  Wildflower and Mark flew out.  Wildflower will be helping guide sport fishermen at a lodge about thirty miles up the coast.  Mark will be returning to his home in Main after a few days of visiting friends here in Alaska.  I gave Wildflower a book my son had given me.  “Down in Bristol Bay” is a book about an English professor at Syracuse who decided to change careers and become a commercial fisherman.  Some of the professor’s escapades were just like the rookie mistakes I have made.  I put a note on the front page of the book thanking Wildflower for all his help this year.  He seemed to appreciate the words left there.

&nbsp;

Yesterday two of the park service men and I struck a deal.  If they would help me get the rope untangled I would lend them waders to cross the river so they could explore that remote beach along the ocean.  It was their day off so across the river we went.  Now these young men work in the maintenance division of the park.  They know how stuff works.  They spend a lot of their time clearing and maintaining the trails here at Dry Bay.  They are strong as oxen.  Energetic as young colts and smart as whips.

&nbsp;

We fought that rope for over an hour.  One method was to find an end and work it back through the tangle.  Another method was to pull on the various loops till we could see clearly how the rats nest was formed.  Both of these approaches resulted in long lengths of very heavy rope extending out from the tangle.  The tangle was way too heavy to lift.  The idea of floating the rope reappeared.  There was quite a current in the river yesterday.  We started pulling the two loose ends and the loops into the water.  Right away the current began sweeping the rope away from us.  This turned out to be exactly what we needed to more easily pull the tangle apart.

&nbsp;

Now all I had to do was get the thing home.     Together we floated the rope back to my side of the river.  I hooked my Honda up to the end of the rope and started across the flat to the cabin.  After about 15 seconds of pulling on one end of the rope the Honda lost traction and buried itself in the sand.  A second Honda was needed to pull on the first one.  That didn’t work either.  Remembering Ranger Kae’s suggestion we waited for the high tide.  The rope now is doubled over in the side yard. And down the driveway...and back along the trail.  One of the men helping me measured it.  The rope is over 600 feet long.   I had designs in mind to coil the rope up in an oval like those braided rugs we have all seen and put it just outside the entrance of the cabin.  It is so big and heavy that might not work.  I’ll keep you posted.",September 1st,,publish,open,open,,1059,,,2014-09-02 10:58:51,2014-09-02 18:58:51,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=1059,0,post,,2

&nbsp;

We fought that rope for over an hour.  One method was to find an end and work it back through the tangle.  Another method was to pull on the various loops till we could see clearly how the rats nest was formed.  Both of these approaches resulted in long lengths of very heavy rope extending out from the tangle.  The tangle was way too heavy to lift.  The idea of floating the rope reappeared.  There was quite a current in the river yesterday.  We started pulling the two loose ends and the loops into the water.  Right away the current began sweeping the rope away from us.  This turned out to be exactly what we needed to more easily pull the tangle apart.

&nbsp;

Now all I had to do was get the thing home.     Together we floated the rope back to my side of the river.  I hooked my Honda up to the end of the rope and started across the flat to the cabin.  After about 15 seconds of pulling on one end of the rope the Honda lost traction and buried itself in the sand.  A second Honda was needed to pull on the first one.  That didn’t work either.  Remembering Ranger Kae’s suggestion we waited for the high tide.  The rope now is doubled over in the side yard. And down the driveway...and back along the trail.  One of the men helping me measured it.  The rope is over 600 feet long.   I had designs in mind to coil the rope up in an oval like those braided rugs we have all seen and put it just outside the entrance of the cabin.  It is so big and heavy that might not work.  I’ll keep you posted.",,,inherit,open,open,,1059-revision-v1,,,2014-09-02 10:57:33,2014-09-02 18:57:33,,1059,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2014/09/02/1059-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

I thought the darker bear was a black bear and the other a grizzly.  The bear biologist said no they were both grizzlies.  The tree on the left is in the front yard.  These bears were about two hundred feet away.

This makes me think the dark bear was the mother of the smaller brown bear.  Right after this shot the neighbor's dogs ran the two bears off from in front of the cabin.

1077,3,2014-09-06 10:09:20,2014-09-06 18:09:20,"A couple of significant things happened since I last reported in.  The first was I remembered to wear a belt around the top of my waders when I went fishing a couple of days ago.  The belt keeps the water from filling your waders should you fall in.  The East River is mostly shallow enough that you can easily stand up should you loose your footing.  I don't usually wear the belt.  I wore it thinking it would be useful to haul the fish I had planned to catch back across from the far side of the river.  I did catch one 13 pound Silver salmon but didn't need the belt to bring that one fish across.  The place where the Vet and I were fishing has one deep hole whose sides are clay.  Slick clay.  I stepped into that hole and could not get out.  No amount of scrambling did any good.  I finally jammed the butt end of the fly rod into the edge of the hole and managed to get on my feet again.  The belt kept the water from filling the waders.  As it was they had water in them only about knee deep.

The other significant thing is the rain.  Yesterday we had over 9 inches.  This month 13.7 inches.  Since the first week of June 48.85 inches.  The rain was accompanied by a 26 mile an hour wind.

Tonight there is a 10.7 foot tide.  That means there won't be any place for the water to go until the rivers can begin to get back to their normal levels.

1078,3,2014-09-06 10:09:20,2014-09-06 18:09:20,"A couple of significant things happened since I last reported in.  The first was I remembered to wear a belt around the top of my waders when I went fishing a couple of days ago.  The belt keeps the water from filling your waders should you fall in.  The East River is mostly shallow enough that you can easily stand up should you loose your footing.  I don't usually wear the belt.  I wore it thinking it would be useful to haul the fish I had planned to catch back across from the far side of the river.  I did catch one 13 pound Silver salmon but didn't need the belt to bring that one fish across.  The place where the Vet and I were fishing has one deep hole whose sides are clay.  Slick clay.  I stepped into that hole and could not get out.  No amount of scrambling did any good.  I finally jammed the butt end of the fly rod into the edge of the hole and managed to get on my feet again.  The belt kept the water from filling the waders.  As it was they had water in them only about knee deep.

The other significant thing is the rain.  Yesterday we had over 9 inches.  This month 13.7 inches.  Since the first week of June 48.85 inches.  The rain was accompanied by a 26 mile an hour wind.

The Vet had a couple of friends come in this week. They will all leave in a few more days. The three of them frequently fish just across Dog Salmon creek from my cabin. To know if the fish are biting all I have to do is sit at my table and watch them. I can enjoy a warm cup of coffee and be entertained by these three excellent fishermen. These salmon usually put up a pretty good fight when you hook one. The fish splashing in the water is easily seen from my easy chair. If I see these men catch a couple of fish I put my refreshment down, (it is not always coffee) put on my waders and join the fun. Park Rangers get to have a little fun from time to time as you can see.  That's the Vet on the wheeler in the background.

Two nights ago I watched a bear cross in front of the cabin heading up Dog Salmon creek.  It had its head up and appeared to be following some scent.  A few minutes later another bear appeared on the other side of the creek.  That one was also following its nose up stream.  There must have been something up there that they couldn’t resist investigating.

One of those bear was wearing a collar.  There are several different groups studying these bears.  Depending on the color of the collar you can tell which group is tracking that bear.  In this case the department of Fish and Game.  Sometimes fishermen leave parts of fish they have caught along the shore.  The bears quickly learn to associate fishermen with fish parts.  This is a sure way to create a problem bear.  A problem bear ends up being a dead bear.

My job list included a note to cut some more firewood.  Yesterday I found log on the beach nearly 30 feet long.  A big log.  The butt end of the log was about 18 inched in diameter.  The other end about 12 inches.  I sawed that log up into 20 some pieces.  Each piece will need to be split into several smaller pieces that will fit into the stove.  I loaded eleven pieces of the log onto the trailer and started the three mile trip back down the beach.  There are two sloughs one must cross before crossing Dog Salmon creek.  There was an 11.6 foot tide yesterday.  Those two sloughs fill with water during a tide that big.  No problem crossing the first slough.  The second slough caught me.

I could tell the Honda was laboring to pull the heavily loaded trailer.  When I began to cross the second slough the sandy bottom had become like quicksand.  The trailer sunk down to the frame.  The Honda couldn’t pull that so it being a four wheel drive machine proceeded it proceeded to dig four holes in the soupy sand bottom.  No problem I thought.  I would just unhook the trailer and drive the Honda away.  Because both machines were firmly planted in the sand even if I got the trailer unhooked I couldn’t move the wheeler away from it. .

I left the trailer loaded with wood and the attached Honda and walked to the Vet’s cabin.  He dropprd what he was doing and we took his wheeler and two ropes back to the slough.  If you were thinking that is a good way to get two Hondas stuck in the sand you would be right.  We figured that out before we stuck his machine and decided to just leave my Honda and the load of wood until the tide went back down.

Remember I mentioned the 11.6 foot tide yesterday.  The Vet went back to check on my equipment right at the peak of the tide.  Only the handle bars of the Honda were above the water.  The trailer with the tote full of wood was listing enough for the rising water to fill the tote the wood was stacked in.  We used a rope about sixty feet long to connect the Vet’s machine to mine.  The rope let him stay on firm ground and he had no problem pulling me out.

Today the submerged Honda got new oil in the engine and transmission.  Both the front and rear differentials got drained and refilled with lubricant.  By removing the spark plug and cranking the engine a few times most of the water gets blown out.  Now for the real test.  With the spark plug reinstalled would it start after spending several hours under water?

I turned the key and pressed the starter button……vroom….. I have a two honda camp again.",September 12,,publish,open,open,,september-12,,,2014-09-12 22:42:47,2014-09-13 06:42:47,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=1090,0,post,,1

A good neighbor from the other side of Dry Bay and I have been canning salmon to take back to our homes.  You might recall in earlier posts we tried adding spices to the unsmoked fish just as we were preparing them to can.  A better tasting produce seems to result if I smoke the salmon after they have been in a mesquite brine.

This morning I went down to the river to play.  After several casts I thought they just are not here this morning.  The tide was flowing the wrong way.  There were several other excuses floating through my mind.  I turned to walk back to the Honda and a fish broke the surface just a little way upstream from where I had been fishing.

I went up there and caught a fish on the first cast.  I caught another one on the second cast.  One got away on my third cast.  After about twenty casts I had my daily limit of four Silver Salmon.  They are in the cooler as I type this.  I’m going to go back over there and fish with a fly that has no barb on the hook.  That way it is easy to release a fish without harming it.  I might catch few that way but with no barb on the hook many of them get off right after they strike.

1097,3,2014-09-18 22:01:56,2014-09-19 06:01:56,"Lots of pictures to share today.

I have been doing some beach combing.  To get across the East River without drowning the Honda yet again, I built this prototype amphibious adapter.  If the water is too deep I just hop off, pull it on across the river into shallower water, hop back on and keep on going.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/floats.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/floats.jpg"" alt=""floats"" width=""448"" height=""252"" /></a>

I went about ten miles down the outer coast today.  It was foggy down there.  This bear waited for me to take its picture.  I was too slow and it decided to move on off.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bear-in-fog.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bear-in-fog.jpg"" alt=""bear in fog"" width=""448"" height=""252"" /></a>

While out on the beach I did manage to find a couple of glass floats.  The little rubber duck looked out of place on that rugged beach so I brought it home too.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ball-and-duck.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1099"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ball-and-duck.jpg"" alt=""ball and duck"" width=""448"" height=""252"" /></a>

The bears are digging roots out of the sand.  This is part of about an acre of excavation some bear completed near the Alsek River.

Have been smoking a lot of fish.  I’ll be heading home soon and there is a little room left in the freezer so I might as well fill it up.  The inside the little building there is a propane burner.  On top of the burner is a heavy pan.  I put Alder twigs in the pan, they heat up and make the smoke.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/smoker-closed.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1103"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/smoker-closed.jpg"" alt=""smoker closed"" width=""448"" height=""252"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/smoker-open.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1104"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/smoker-open.jpg"" alt=""smoker open"" width=""448"" height=""252"" /></a>

Two days ago Ranger Kae and I walked up coast about five miles then floated back down the river to the cabin.  These Pack Rafts are really neat.  They weigh about six pounds. They fold up and easily fit into a back pack.  To blow the thing up you use a bag with a connector on one end.  The connector screws into the raft and then you just catch some air in the bag, close the open end and squeeze the air into the raft.

Coming back down the river turned out to not be a matter of drifting along with the current.  The tide was pushing water upstream.  We had to paddle against the current and wind all the way back.

Going across the East Alsek River to the outer coast one day I snapped this picture.  Right now I am sitting in that cabin typing this.  It is hard for me to believe how lucky I am to be here in this beautiful place.  Sitting here writing about associating with experts on one of the most magnificent animals on the planet.  Sitting here thinking about that same collard bear, mentioned above, who was out front of the cabin tonight chasing salmon in the that river in the picture.  It is easy for me to get emotional typing this stuff.

I’m loving it!

Going across the East Alsek River to the outer coast one day I snapped this picture.  Right now I am sitting in that cabin typing this.  It is hard for me to believe how lucky I am to be here in this beautiful place.  Sitting here writing about associating with experts on one of the most magnificent animals on the planet.  Sitting here thinking about that same collard bear, mentioned above, who was out front of the cabin tonight chasing salmon in the that river in the picture.  It is easy for me to get emotional typing this stuff.  I’m loving it!

1112,3,2014-09-19 20:54:57,2014-09-20 04:54:57,"A couple of days ago I mentioned a collared bear that was acting a little aggressive.  The Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve bear biologist reads the stuff I type here and she contacted me about said bear.  She is really interesting to talk with about these creatures that are my natural neighbors here.  Anyway she had spoken with some of the people in the Fish and Game department.  They wondered if I gotten the number printed on the bear’s collar.

Now I will do anything I can to respond to a request from this biologist.  The next time I see this bear I will try and sneak up on it, pull the hair back out of the way, get my pencil and pad out and jot down the number on the collar.  I may be stretching this a bit.  But I did respond to her written request today by writing back that I had asked the bear for his number but the bear didn’t respond.  Maybe he did respond but I didn’t have my hearing aids in that day so I didn’t catch what he said.  I know Tania will read this.  I hope my ramblings don’t put her off or cause one of her bear friends to get pissed at me.

Below are a couple of bear related pictures.  The bears are more persistent beachcombers than I am.  Every time I go out on the beach, it is easy to find bear tracks.  These animals patrol the tide lines for any morsel that might have washed in.  They investigate almost everything.  In the second picture the bear had walked over to this glass fishing float, probably gave it a sniff, and then moved on.

The contest began down near the former hangout of the master himself “The Vet”.  Specifically a place here to fore known as Mossy Point.  That moniker makes sense because the clear shallow water produces enough algae to interfere with the equipment used during the game.  The Coho were ready to rumble.  This bunch were well prepared for anything MR would throw at them.  In the first quarter of the game the Coho intercepted three different lures MR presented and swam off with them.  These fish were really hot tonight.  Those three interceptions were on three consecutive passes.  MR and his equipment manager called time out and huddled back at the cabin.

With the game at three to nothing Coho, something had to change.  The line between the MR team and his opposition needed reworking.  The light and agile 8 pound test was no match for this rowdy bunch of Coho.  MR found some 20 pound test line on some old equipment in the locker room.  With nothing to lose but more lures, MR took a chance on this old but experienced line.

The battle resumed.  There were at least five near interceptions when a Coho would chase the lure from deep in its territory into water so shallow the attacker’s back was out of the water.  Folks you got to understand with this old line doing the work a lot of precise coaching was in order.  The primary terminal equipment was a single hook lure with no barb.  Neither team wanted unnecessary injuries.

So, using this non-lethal terminal equipment the Coho were able to make several tips and close calls.  These near misses were causing a lot of stress on MR, but the old line and the specialized terminal tackle finally began to turn the game around.

The contest continued until it was necessary to call a halt because of darkness.  The Coho seemed to have brought in some reinforcements because Mossy Point was nearly boiling with their antics along the sideline.  Eight of the Coho gang had felt the agony of defeat but they all were back in the game with their team mates when the game was postponed.  The Midnight Rambler, his trusty companion Louis and the old line are now sitting by the wood stove wondering where and when the battle will resume.

For some reason I was out early one morning.  It was so clear Mount St. Elias looked like it was just a few miles away.  Checking on the computer it is actually 121 miles from here.  That same morning the Sandhill Cranes Began to show up in large numbers.  Wave after wave passed over.  That continued for most of the morning.  Thousands of them were winging their way South.

The season is obvious in other ways too.  The Alders and Willows have lost about half their leaves.  No beautiful fall colors there.  They go from green to shriveled up brown and fall.  They do leave in the air the fragrance of fall and the smell of the leaves I remember from childhood.

A few days ago there was a photograph here of the holes a bear had left in the sand from digging up roots.  Out along the trail they are also busy digging up some sort of morsel.  One can go along for a couple of miles and not see any sign of bear activity then come across a spot that looks like they ran a rototiller across the moss.

Below are the results of a couple of cabin type projects.  The big hawser we pulled across the river is now a welcome mat.  That mat is made up of almost 500 feet of that big rope.

The second version of the “flotation attachment” on the Honda worked fairly well.  The machine floated a little higher with this version but some more refinement should be made before I send the design in to the patent office.

<p>When we last spoke I gave him a six day window as to when I would like to leave.  That is the way it has to be this time of year.  The weather can change so quickly from mild to severe in just a few hours.  The fancy weather station the kids gave me last June had this to say about the last few months:</p>
<p>In June the highest wind was 21 mph, highest rain rate per hour 2.21” and the total rain fall 2.87”.  For July the same numbers were: 22mph, 1.92” per hour and 10.28 inched for the month.  August: 31 mph, 5.7"" per hour and 21.7"" for the month.  September so far:  wind 62 mph, 2.68” per hour and 26.22 inches of rain for the month.  To save you the trouble that is 61.07 inches of rain since the second week of June…over 5 feet.  The lowest temperature since I have been here was 32 degrees and the highest was 69 according to the weather station.   Most days the temp wouldn’t vary more than 15 degrees.</p>
<p>The high tide this afternoon sent the water right up into the grass at the end of the drive way.  There were small fish splashing right in the drive.  Louis was on guard down by the water’s edge and Park Ranger Kae was practicing one of her hobbies, photography, out there too.</p>

Last night a list was created that had 28 chores on it that I need to get finished before I fly out tomorrow.  Good progress was made on the list today.  One of the chores was to go back over to the ranger station and retrieve Kae’s bottle collection.  .  Kae left Dry Bay yesterday.  She didn’t have room to pack away her collection so she asked me if I would adopt these bottles until such time she can retrieve them.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bottles.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1135"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bottles.jpg"" alt=""bottles"" width=""437"" height=""336"" /></a>

On the way over there I noticed new snow on the mountains.  It rained at the cabin most of the morning.  Obviously at about two thousand feet the rain fell as snow.

The weather started changing this afternoon.  The wind shifted around to the North and a breeze picked up.  The temperature will probably drop below freezing tonight.  The humidity is usually in the 90+ percent range.  Right now it is at 46% the lowest I have seen it in the five months I have been here.  The air is crystal clear and Mt Saint Elias even being 121 miles away stands out as clearly as those much closer.

I spent a lot of time walking around outside today ignoring the chore list.  As the weather changed the sky did too.  This picture with the descending clouds reminded me of stallions carrying in the winter weather.  Don’t know why it just did.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ghost-riders.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1141"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ghost-riders-1024x602.jpg"" alt=""ghost riders"" width=""1024"" height=""602"" /></a>

It has been noted here before how the mountains surround this part of the coast.  I have read some of these peaks haven’t even been named.  I wonder if what I was looking at this afternoon has ever felt the pressure of a human’s foot on its surface.

<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rugged.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1137"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rugged.jpg"" alt=""rugged"" width=""448"" height=""299"" /></a>

Back at the cabin I took this picture of the trail that runs along the side of the cabin.  Louis and I walk out that way most mornings.  He is usually in front on bear patrol and I am following whistling a tune form the movie “Oh Brother Where Art Thou”.  I bet the bears think it’s pretty ridiculous those two old creatures passing through their territory.  Sometimes it is hard to pinpoint where the sound of a honda is coming from.  I probably looked up that little trail 200 times this summer wondering if someone was coming by from that direction.

Louis was Nancy’s dog.  Louis has always liked women more than men.  I think it has to do with the sound of a woman’s voice and the gentler touch they have when they scratch his back.  This evening in the clouds I saw Louis looking at a lady who was looking into the setting sun.  I don’t know if you can see them but to me they are as clear as the sky behind them.

I’m having a hard time leaving this place.  Tonight there were Lesser Canada geese out front ...just passing through …heading South.  Earlier Sandhill Cranes were circling above the cabin, catching thermals, gaining altitude to sail on down the coast.  While watching them, I saw two raptors, way up high, gliding in the same direction.  I will be following them all very soon.

Good night from Dry Bay

Paul arrived exactly on time.  He brought along his wife Amy and a friend of her's.  They wanted to film some takeoffs and landings in a remote spot so they choose to do that right outside the cabin.

No problem getting everything loaded.  We flew the 100 miles back to Haines via a scenic route through the mountains.  He wanted to show the ladies some of the sights.  It was a perfect day to do that.

At Haines the plan was to load the fish into a freezer just like the one at the cabin. My truck has a 110 volt outlet in the bed.  I thought I would just plug the loaded freezer in and drive home with the fish still frozen.  Two things happened.  The first was the freezer wouldn't go into the truck unless I took the top off.  Second the 110 volt circuit couldn't handle the power requirements of the freezer.

We hit the road anyway about 3:30.  That night we made it through Canadian customs with no problem and stayed in Haines Junction., YT Yesterday we got about 550 miles closer to home and stayed in a neat cabin at Toad River, BC.  Along the way yesterday we saw Moose, Elk, Bison and a black bear grazing on the wide shoulders of the Alaska Highway.  In Whitehorse added some dry ice to the freezer.  That should keep the fish frozen for a few more days.

It is about 6:30 in the morning now.  Waiting for the resturant to open.  Louis has eaten.  I'll feed the truck, get something for myself then head South.  One time son Joe and I stopped at a state park and rented a couple of horses to ride back into a canyon.  Those old nags needed a lot of prompting to get them started.  Needed prompting until we turned around.  Those horses showed us what poor riders we were as they nearly ran back to the comfort of their corral.  I'm getting into that mode now.  I'm ready to head back to the barn in Boulder.",October 3rd,,publish,open,open,,october-3rd,,,2014-10-03 05:43:36,2014-10-03 13:43:36,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=1145,0,post,,1

My truck has a 110 volt outlet in the bed.  I thought I would just plug the loaded freezer in and drive home with the fish still frozen.  Two things happened.  The first was the freezer wouldn't go into the truck unless I took the top off.  Second the 110 volt circuit couldn't handle the power requirements of the freezer.

We hit the road anyway about 3:30.  That night we made it through Canadian customs with no problem and stayed in Haines Junction., YT Yesterday we got about 550 miles closer to home and stayed in a neat cabin at Toad River, BC.  Along the way yesterday we saw Moose, Elk, Bison and a black bear grazing on the wide shoulders of the Alaska Highway.  In Whitehorse added some dry ice to the freezer.  That should keep the fish frozen for a few more days.

It is about 6:30 in the morning now.  Waiting for the resturant to open.  Louis has eaten.  I'll feed the truck, get something for myself then head South.  One time son Joe and I stopped at a state park and rented a couple of horses to ride back into a canyon.  Those old nags needed a lot of prompting to get them started.  Needed prompting until we turned around.  Those horses showed us what poor riders we were as they nearly ran back to the comfort of their corral.  I'm getting into that mode now.  I'm ready to head back to the barn in Boulder.",October 3rd,,inherit,open,open,,1145-revision-v1,,,2014-10-03 05:43:36,2014-10-03 13:43:36,,1145,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/2014/10/03/1145-revision-v1/,0,revision,,0

On the road today interesting sights were caribou, a black bear, a couple of moose pizzas (runover during the winter) a coyote.  There was quite a bit of snow along the road at higher elevations.  The wind was fairly strong.  I saw agree that had been blown onto the power line.  There were lots of sparks and then an explosion of blue flame.  The top of the tree was on fire.

The above is the start of the Alaska Highway.  This same picture appeared hear last year but with a different truck.  Last years truck never ran out of gas.  I did hear the same ""ding"" I heard yesterday again today.  This time I was about twenty miles from a gas station.  I ran out.  Fortunately for me About five minutes after I rolled off the side of the road two angles disguised as business men came along, gave me a lift to town, helped me buy a gas can and then took me back to the truck.  I owe them a huge thanks.  I promised I will return the favor for some other stranger.  Thank you again Jim and Tony.

On the road today interesting sights were caribou, a black bear, a couple of moose pizzas (runover during the winter) a coyote.  There was quite a bit of snow along the road at higher elevations.  The wind was fairly strong.  I saw agree that had been blown onto the power line.  There were lots of sparks and then an explosion of blue flame.  The top of the tree was on fire.

Yesterday we drove by dozens of Bison who were grazing along the shoulder of the road.  A moose raced us along the highway for a short distance.  We saw two different black bears and a few more caribou.  The prettiest sight were the flocks of ptarmigan along the roadside. These birds are pure white in the winter for camouflage turn mottled brown for the same reason in the summer.  Some of the ones we saw were beginning to turn on their summer plumage.  As we passed them the sun was getting low.  These birds looked like snow balls lighted from within as the sun reflected off them.  There is still a lot of  snow in the mountains but as I decended back to sea level spring has returned.

Louis and I discussed how we had driven away from spring on this trip.  Back home the trees are about half way budded out.  As we came North all the deleciate, tender green of the budding trees had disappeared.  In about the last thirty miles of the trip spring came back.

The plan is to fly on over to the cabin this afternoon.  Because this is the first flight over there from Haines this year, Paul, the pilot, wanted to be sure not to arrive at the high tide.  One never knows what the winter might have done to the normal landing spots.

Last October when I took the Hughesnet antenna down I may have disturbed one of the adjustments that aligns the antenna with the sattilite.  If that is the case I may not be able to post anything else here until mid-May when some of the neighbors with undisturbed antennas show up.

If my good luck holds that won't be an issue.  Another piece of luck will be if I can get a few of the pictures I took recently to show up here:  it is about 15 minutes after I typed the colon above.  Working with the iPad and getting the pictures to show up where I want them to is proving to be difficult.  In the picture below note the road in the background.  It is so beautiful here I'm glad you don't have to depend on my words to describe the scenes.

If Marie Keene was still around, today would have been her birthday. Reflecting on that, today is still her birthday but she's not here to celebrate with us. She she was the product of a conservative rural farm family. She married a widower who had a child. She bore two more children with him before he died at age thirty. She never let another man into her life though I recall a couple tried.  She raised those two daughters and one son by herself. Self sufficient throughout her life.

If Marie Keene was still around, today would have been her birthday. Reflecting on that, today is still her birthday but she's not here to celebrate with us. She she was the product of a conservative rural farm family. She married a widower who had a child. She bore two more children with him before he died at age thirty. She never let another man into her life though I recall a couple tried.  She raised those two daughters and one son by herself. Self sufficient throughout her life.

For the second time this week I shook my head with amusement at what it takes for the locals to get around up here.

As the season progresses there will be more small plane traffic, flying low,under 500 feet, up and down the coast. In many cases you recognize the plane and make a pretty good guess as to who is in it and where they are headed. Not unlike the cars in your neighborhood. The two times I referred to were when I could hear a small plane, flying low, approaching. I knew it was my neighbor PR because they have a red and white plane with a nose wheel like a tricycle rather than a tail wheel. He lands on the gravel runway to the left of my place then taxes up to their cabin. Parks the plane less than 100 feet from their cabin door and proceeds to unload several totes of supplies. He can't stay for coffee. There is too much to do. Hops back in the plane and is gone in less than ten minutes. During his second trip he mentioned a couple more people with cabins near mine would be showing up on the next few days.

Sure enough two more did show up late in the day. They left Yakutat at nine on the morning and arrived here around six in the evening. BS and LR had driven BS's new Honda down the beach some 50 miles, crossing at least three rivers along the way. I'd like to make that trip someday.

Tomorrow a storm is supposed to come in. The forecast is it will last through Saturday. There will be a few inside chores to do but my time may mostly be spent reading ""THE GOLDFINCH"" by Donna Tartt. The book caught my eye initially because of the nature sounding title and picture on the cover. Later I saw where it won the Pulitzer Prize. The first few pages didn't grab me but now I can't get it off my mind.

I learned a new dance yesterday. I'll call it the ""shakey foot"" It has been so dry I was just wearing sneakers while working outside. Deciding to burn a pile of brush accumulated from the 2014 ice storm. The fire was going nicely. Flames maybe ten feet high at times. I kept pushing the ends of the burning limbs deeper into the center of the fire. Those low cut sneakers/running shoes have the screen type upper material. Sometimes a spruce needle will work its way through that screen and irritate ones foot. Something was irritating my left foot and just thought I could shift my weight to my right leg and shake the needle out of my left shoe. That didn't work. I shook harder. I even grabbed onto a tree to keep my balance and continued to shake the heck out of my left foot. The irritation was getting much worse. I looked down and the screen material on my shoe had a quarter size hole surrounded by little red glowing embers. The Cabela's wool sock under the screen had a hole in it too. The pink and white toe under the sock, under the screen didn't have a hole in it but it wanted out from under the hole. Now normally one would just stomp out a small ember like that. Since my right leg was busy holding me up stomping out the inferno with that appendage wouldn't work. Solution; fall flat on my butt and jerk the shoe and sock off.

Yesterday about all that happened is it rained a quarter of an inch. I did go up the beach and again found no treasures. Maybe I already mentioned rather than come home empty handed I have decided if I don't have any luck beach combing I will bring home a log to be turned into fire wood. Which I did.

I'm typing this as good old Louis has taken my place on the left side of the bed. Today it has rained almost a half inch. These rainy days when there is no real pressing work to do it is easy to sit around and read, doze off for a while, read some more, lie down on the bed, feel guilty for not doing anything, get up and read some more. Then repeat.

But that is not what makes today special. Today Louis and I had a real bear encounter. As we usually do right after we got up we went outside to relieve ourselves, scratch a little, stretch then open our eyes. Louis went off to the left and I angled off toward the right.

A movement at the base of a spruce tree at the edge of the yard caught my eye. Peering out was a grizzly. First thought was; what a great picture that would be. This big bear right in the yard. Second thought was; I don't have the camera and I don't dare take my eye off this guy to go get one because he was so close. (I later stepped off the distance. He was less than 60 feet away. That's about three car lengths). The next thought was; what was that black streak rushing past me barking at the bear. The bear started away as I cheered Louis on. But then the situation changed.

The bear stopped and turned toward Louis. Louis also stopped since the bear wasn't doing what he thought the bear should be doing. The bear, focused on Louis started back toward him. Hoping the bear wouldn't break into a charge for Louis I went toward him yelling for all I was worth. The bear turned away again. So did Louis and I. When I turned back around the bear was coming toward us again. It seemed he had a hot dog on his mind.

By now I was pissed at the bear for seeming to threaten my pal so I ran back into the cabin and grabbed the shotgun. I had some rubber bullets in the magazine. As I ran toward him the bear turned away. I got close enough that I shot him in the butt with one of the rubber bullets. I think the noise startled him but the rubber bullet seemed to have no affect.

I should note, I believe this same bear came out of the woods while my neighbor was here unloading some supplies. The neighbor had his dog Charlie with him. Charlie is a real German bear dog. When Charlie went after the bear it ran a short way then stopped and turned back on the dog. After a few seconds stand off the bear proceeded to stroll away. Not in rush just seeming to say ""this ain't worth it"". That makes me think this bear could be a problem at some point in the future.

So, being upset with this bear, and the rubber bullet not bothering him too much (I should have been closer when I shot) I hopped on the Honda and went after him. After running the bear down the beach a ways I discovered I could kind of steer the bear in the direction I wanted him to go by pilling up along side it as he ran. Later I went back and guesstimated that guy was covering almost 20 feet each running stride he made with me in third gear on the Honda beside him. To test this theory I directed him into the East River. Those animals are so powerful hitting the water hardly seemed to slow him down at all.

Back at the cabin I thanked Louis for being such a brave dog. I also thanked my lucky stars for being able to experience things like this, with him.",May 8,,publish,open,open,,may-8,,,2015-05-08 15:07:50,2015-05-08 23:07:50,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=1187,0,post,,2

During the night I woke up thinking today is Mothers Day. Mothers Day seems a lot more important than most days of the year. More important to me than Easter or Christmas or Fathers Day or certainly my birthday. There have been way to many of those or, on second thought, maybe not near enough.

Maybe the reason I have been busy in the kitchen this morning is some subliminal memory of the pleasant experiences that have come out of other kitchens. Kitchens I have had the pleasure of enjoying while mothers I have known went about the magic they weave in those rooms.

Up here in the remoteness right now there is only one mother I can wish a happy day too. LR is a couple of cabins away. Her husband flew in late yesterday to spend today with her. Yesterday I invited her and the other neighbor who happens to be here right now to a pasta dinner. They begged off but took a rain check for tonight.

So the reason I have been busy in the kitchen is to bake brownies with pecans inside and Carmel drizzled over the top. They have about fifteen minutes to go in the oven and the place smells great right now. The thought of sitting on the radiator in my Mother's kitchen waiting for something delicious (cinnamon toast) to come out of the oven is making me smile.

Anyway it is a beautiful Mothers Day here. I hope wherever the Mothers who read this are having a wonderful day too. Doesn't matter if they are in Kentucky, Texas, Utah, Colorado, Alaska. I hope as you read this you know this message is for you.

HAPPY MOTHERS DAY.

Yesterday I went down to the mouth of the river to see if any salmon were coming in with the push of the tide as it started in. I thought I saw a couple of fish. It seems a little early but what the heck. Who am I to tell the salmon when to arrive.

This afternoon rod in hand, tide coming in, no salmon. There were quite a few Dolly Varden trout to be caught. Released all of them. The droplets in the air became BB size and were being driven by a ten mph wind so I came home and finished the novel I have been reading.

Yesterday's fog lifted overnight but settled back in by dawn. The weather broadcast on the VHF radio said it should clear this afternoon. If that happens we would fly to the camp.

Having just checked with the neighbor the plan B is to drive the wheelers the up the beach to the sport camp. That will require fording two rivers. I'm all for that. The 25 mile ride would take us by just one cabin. All that distance without any serious beachcomber competition. The problem is we would probably be covering that 25 miles in about an hour. That is way, Way to fast to find treasures.

If we use plan B we wouldn't leave till about three this afternoon. The tide would be near its lowest by the time we needed to cross the second river around four. We would load the wheelers in a boat to cross the first river. At the second river, much smaller, we could wade across at low tide.

""It wasn't long ago when living within the natural world was the rule rather than the exception, when most people were farmers, shepards and cattle drivers, loggers, cheese makers, butter churners, builders with wood and stone, fisherfolk.  Before that --- in fact, for ninety nine percent of the time humans have lived on earth --- they were hunters and gatherers.  Our ancestors knew where they fit into a world that was larger than themselves and what the connections , were between weather and food, predator and prey, wonder and cruelty.  Their understanding, though lacking the cold precision we expect today from Western science, was no less legitimate for being contained instead within elaborate sets of myths,""

She went on to say "" It doesn't take much checking to recognize the extent of today's estrangement between people and nature, work and the natural environment.  For most of us today nature is what's on TV's nature programs, or it's a vacation spot , preferably sunny.""

Reflectimg on Nancy Lord's words  I feel very lucky to be here this close to nature.  This close to my/our ancient roots.  A couple of times each year I close one of these posts with the following --- I'm loving it--- I really do.

To get over to the sport camp I have been writing about we have to cross two rivers.  To transport a boat between rivers or just to get a boat out of the water without having a trailer, a modification is made so wheels can be added and removed from the boat as needed.  Here we are putting the boat into the Alsek River.

Once the wheels are pulled off the boat you pull it up parallel to the shore and load the wheeler.  We needed the wheeler to make the 25 mile run down the coast to the next river.  That's Fathom's Dad doing the hard part.<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-19-post-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1212"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May-19-post-1.jpg"" alt=""May 19 post 1"" width=""336"" height=""448"" /></a>

That's me being glad Fathom's Dad loaded the Honda.  On the other side of the Alsek we pull this boat out of the water, re-install the wheels and leave it up above the tide line.  No need to take this big boat the 25 miles up the coast.  There is another smaller boat for the smaller river we have to cross next.

We crossed the next river with this boat.  On the way home three of us plus Charlie the bear dog and the wheeler were all in this vessel at the same time The water was about the level of the top of the wheels. As we crossed nobody  made any sudden moves. No rocking the boat when the water is just inches from coming over the sides.  I should note however, this second river isn't very deep or swift.  If one fell out of the boat all you would have to do is stand up and walk on out.

Sunday, two weeks from today the first commercial fishing begins for those of us here at Dry Bay.  Some, not already occupied sawing wood, finishing cabins, moving sport camps are getting the fishing gear ready.   I pulled a couple of nets out of storage today.  If I can get to the right web sites I hope to see how to mend the torn places.

There have been many eagles hanging around the beach and rivers.  They seem to know something is about to happen.  What that is I haven’t a clue but I’d bet it has to do with food.  The one below was perched on the gateway to the Vet’s cabin.  The Vet is a retired veterinarian and is a wonderful man even if his political views don’t align with mine.  Last year he noticed Louis eating a scrap of paper.  The Vet exclaimed “My God man do you realize how much money you could save by feeding him paper instead of dog food”.  He is coming back to his cabin here this week.  The Vet sent me an email asking if I needed anything.   I responded:  “Louis could use some paper to eat.  The New York Times would be OK.  Something liberal you know.”  The Vet responded:  “John:  It is reassuring to know that Lewis has the good sense to turn the Times into it;s most useful form.”…I think he probably meant dog poop.

1259,3,2015-05-30 20:48:44,2015-05-31 04:48:44,"Yesterday the boat went to the harbor across Dry Bay.  Dry Bay shows up on some maps to the South East of the Alsek River’s mouth.  From some of the reading I have done the area got its name because years ago there may have been some deceiving water over the area.  If there was it was very shallow.  Now days in periods of heavy rain the part that at one time may have looked like a bay still does but most of the time it looks like the picture below.

&nbsp;

There is a trail across the “Dry Bay” we call the super highway.  There are only a couple of curves in the four miles or so across the desert like area.   One can run his Honda wide open across there if one chooses.  Not pulling a boat though.

It has been very foggy the last few days.  I knew fog is the result of the air not being able to hold any more moisture.  Terms like relative humidity and dew point have something to do with that but I wasn’t sure how they related.  They were a mystery to me.  Google had plenty of explanations to offer.  Some of the explanations left me clueless but here are a couple that made some sense.

<em>“Humidity is a term that describes the amount of water vapor in the air whereas dew point is the temperature at which moisture in the air - humidity – begins to condense”</em>

<em>“Humidity is the amount of moisture in the air but not necessarily “condensed” moisture.  Dew Point is the temperature at which the moisture in the air will start to condense and become liquid.  When dew point and temperature are within 4 degrees F you will get fog”</em>

Mystery solved.  Right now my weather center says the dew point is 49 and the temperature is 50.  It is also very foggy outside.

1262,3,2015-05-30 20:48:44,2015-05-31 04:48:44,"Yesterday the boat went to the harbor across Dry Bay.  Dry Bay shows up on some maps to the South East of the Alsek River’s mouth.  From some of the reading I have done the area got its name because years ago there may have been some deceiving water over the area.  If there was it was very shallow.  Now days in periods of heavy rain the part that at one time may have looked like a bay still does but most of the time it looks like the picture below.

&nbsp;

There is a trail across the “Dry Bay” we call the super highway.  There are only a couple of curves in the four miles or so across the desert like area.   One can run his Honda wide open across there if one chooses.  Not pulling a boat though.

It has been very foggy the last few days.  I knew fog is the result of the air not being able to hold any more moisture.  Terms like relative humidity and dew point have something to do with that but I wasn’t sure how they related.  They were a mystery to me.  Google had plenty of explanations to offer.  Some of the explanations left me clueless but here are a couple that made some sense.

<em>“Humidity is a term that describes the amount of water vapor in the air whereas dew point is the temperature at which moisture in the air - humidity – begins to condense”</em>

<em>“Humidity is the amount of moisture in the air but not necessarily “condensed” moisture.  Dew Point is the temperature at which the moisture in the air will start to condense and become liquid.  When dew point and temperature are within 4 degrees F you will get fog”</em>

Mystery solved.  Right now my weather center says the dew point is 49 and the temperature is 50.  It is also very foggy outside.

Some of these old Japanese fishing floats have marks on them.  The marks might signify the fishing company or the boat being fished from or the village where the ball was made.  There are a couple of books that describe the various markings and in some cases describe what the mark represents.

One of the books described the mark on this float as being “exceedingly rare.”  The other book had this to say; “It has been found only on blue-green 3- inch diameter glass balls.  Beachcombed around the Pacific and still found in Japanese gear piles in fishing villages on the Eastern coast of Hokkaido and in the extreme Northern tip, just south of Russia.  Uncommon.”

Good thing number two was the email came through on how to register the satellite phone.  That turned out to be a piece of cake.  So, anxious to test the thing, I took the little base station out and set it on a stump in the front yard.  Back inside the cabin, I made calls to the kids in Kentucky….no problem.

Good thing number three was I got the locations pinned down where I will set the three nets when the commercial fishing starts Sunday at noon.  On the way back from the river another nice thing happened.  Motoring along off the regular trail I spotted a cluster of Lupines unlike the millions of others.  These were a very dark purple with almost no white petals.  For comparison the second picture is the standard model.

This is the first fish of the year.  This King Salmon weighed about 18 pounds.  I kept one of the Kings to smoke.  I'll check the weather.  Smoking the fish requires one to be around the smoker most of a day.  The weather is what usually determines if I stay near the cabin or not.  So if the weather is not so great I'll smoke the fish.

A few days this group of hikers were here for a short visit.  Their schedule to be picked up by the bush plane had to be flexible.  So between the time they arrived and when the plane showed up I had the pleasure of their company.  Great folks!

The finishing up amounted to vacuum packing most of the King salmon that got smoked.  It seems a little salty to me but everyone else who has tried it think it is delicious.

The fishing was with my neighbor the Vet.  We went up river to a place called Steve’s Island.  The Vet is a terrific fisherman.  We didn’t see a single fish.  Today in front of his cabin there were several Sockeye rising but none of them were interested in anything the Vet or I offered them.

One of the getting ready chores took me back over to the boat harbor.  A couple of the nets needed attention.  The one that got stuck on the bottom last week needed mending.  The second net turned out to be illegal this year.  The Dept. of Fish and Game placed a 6” limit on the size mesh one can use in the Alsek River.  The short net I was using was bigger than that.  So one of the chores today was to find another short net that was legal.

Wildlife activity amounted to seeing a bear or two on almost every trip over to the harbor.  I haven’t seen a bear from here in the cabin for two or three weeks.  There was a wolf out front this morning.  A beautiful healthy looking animal.  Louis and I had already had an early walk.  The wolf approached where we had been very cautiously.  I guess he could smell where we had been walking.  Rather than get too close to where we had been it crossed the river and proceeded up the other side.  I tried using the camera with the long lens to get a picture but it was just too far away.  This young Bald Eagle was less than twenty feet away while I unloaded the nets from the boat.

On the way over to the river I thought there was a fire.  A great plume of what I thought was smoke was rising into the air.  It turned out to be sand blowing odd the sand bars out on the river.  It is so dry and the wind today was coming right down the throat of the river.

The wind’s direction made it VERY difficult to tend the nets.  When I check a net for fish the usual way is to ease the boat up to the net, being careful to stay down wind or down current so the boat doesn’t cross over the net.  Today the wind was so strong you couldn’t “ease” up to the net.  You had to run up to it under power.  Fishing by myself that meant when I reached the net I had to run to the front of the boat, lean over the bow and try to grab the net.  The wind today would blow the boat back before I could get to the net.  By driving over the net I could grab it as I was blown back but sometime the boat’s motor would get caught in the net.  What a mess it was for 2 Kings and six sockeye.

Yesterday was better.  I caught ten kings and sixteen sockeye.  Five of the kings were small so I kept them.  They are now in the freezer.  I kept these smaller fish rather than sell King Salmon for the pittance being offered.  $0.58 per pound.  Larger fish are going for $2.08 a pound.  Last year I was getting over $4.00.

I cleaned those fish in the creek in front of the cabin.  The eagles and gulls always gather for the scraps.  The biggest scraps are the head and skeleton of the fish.  That weighs enough that the eagles can’t gain much altitude after they grab the treat out of the water.

The human traffic was caused by my telling one of the neighbors I had seen a King Salmon down at the mouth of the East River.  As far as I know nobody has caught a King sport fishing this year.  Last year there were plenty of fish to catch with a rod and reel if you wanted to put in the time.  This year the fish are very scarce.  Those few that do show up have lock jaw and won’t bite.

The other traffic was out by the outhouse.  It would be interesting if the bears could communicate with us in written or verbal ways.  I expect there would be signs all over the place that said things like; “Keep out of my patch of woods”.  “This territory between the big rock and the spruce tree is mine”.“All the stuff on this stretch of beach belongs to me”.  Things like that that would let us humans know what they are trying to tell us and other animals.

There was a bear trying to do that night before last out back.  On my way to the outhouse yesterday  morning I noticed a bear  had left a deposit in the trail.  That’s not unusual.  They poop a lot.  Approaching the building there was  this serpentine mark on the path.  This bear was really trying to get my attention by urinating along the  path I take.

Finally the bruin backed up to a tree just outside the outhouse door and left some more sign.  These bears seem to have a few favorite trees where they mark their territories and scratch their backs.  Note the  bear hair clinging to the tree.

Yesterday in preparation for today’s fishing I set a couple of the nets out on the bank.  All I have to do today is grab that white float in the foreground and back the boat out into the river.  If all goes well the net will follow without getting tangled up.

The Vet found the fish yesterday.  We had been having no luck sport fishing.  The fish were in the river but wouldn’t “hole up”.  They just kept heading upstream.  The Vet found where they were congregating. There were so many fish in this spot that you might get three strikes while retrieving a cast.  Sockeye are hard to hook.  The fly I was using seemed to be what they wanted.  The first picture features the new fly rod and reel I got from a family friend in Texas.  The second picture features that new rod “broken, snapped into.  Those fish are very strong and put up a terrific fight.  Somewhere along the way I must have nicked the rod creating a weak spot.  There was a second outfit available.  With it several more fish were landed.

The fishing was good enough that the Department of Fish and Wildlife extended the opener for a second day. So we got to fish from noon on Sunday till noon Tuesday.

The spots I fished last year and this year until today were just not producing very many fish. I tried a couple of new spots and the results improved. My numbers are nothing like some of the old timers. I might bring in 10% of the fish they do some days. But I’m excited about next week’s opening. I kept 5 of the sockeye. They are resting in the freezer now. Soon I have to figure out how to ship some home. The freezer there is empty.

When I came home this afternoon there was an Amazon package at the door. Grape Jelly, Sweet Baby Ray’s Barbecue sauce and some AA batteries. Now I feel complete. I already had plenty of peanut butter.

Another morale booster was the new satellite phone worked perfectly and allowed me to speak with a guy in Bellingham, WA about some fishing gear I need. The stuff is on its way.

My sister introduced to one of those web sites that send out a daily inspirational message. I read then delete most of them. I just don’t get the message in some of them. I did get this one though.

Remember the sky you were born under,
know each of the star’s stories.
Remember the moon, know who she is.
Remember the sun’s birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time. Remember sundown
and the giving away to night.
Remember your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of

Remember the sun’s birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time. Remember sundown
and the giving away to night.
Remember your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of
her life, and her mother’s, and hers.
Remember your father. He is your life, also.
Remember the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.

The Park Service hosted the annual fisherman's meeting today. We got to meet the new superintendent. He seems like a nice enough guy.

There were chores that needed doing here at the cabin. Don't know what if anything I might have missed by being one of the first to leave. One of the chores was to go back through all my nets. The ten fathom net needed to be replaced. By sorting through the longer nets I found one with several holes in it. By using the best part of that net I now have a new ten fathom net.

One of tomorrow's chores will be to finish up that modification. The forecast is for rain the next few days. So late this afternoon the fly rod and I went fishing again. Two big Sockeye succumbed to my offerings and two more thought they liked what was offered but spit out the hook before I could land them.

The waders have a small leak high up the left leg. The forecasted rain started while i was fishing. My light weight shirt was soon soaked and half my legs were wet. Don't remember the last time I was shivering but this afternoon reminded me of what that felt like.

Good news when I got back to the cabin. An Amazon delivery was dropped off by a neighbor. More Grape Nuts on the shelf now.

Watched a bear cross the river just down from the house today. It has been so warm and dry the feeling is most of them are back in the mountains where it is cooler.

Here we are the last day of June. This week's commercial fishing opener was disappointing in that it lasted only 24 hours. The spot my nets were set produced better for me than any thing else so far this season. I caught fifty fish that weighted right at three hundred pounds. Kept half of them. There must be a huge number of fish coming in someplace else to keep the price so low. I am getting just $0.93 a pound for what most consider the finest sockeye salmon in the world.

The Internet is still down at my cabin. I will post some pictures when my system is back up.

The wolf was back yesterday morning. There was a moose out back.  No bear sightings recently. The seals only stole a couple of fish from me.

That means there will be some money made. Not much money at ninety three cents a pound but a little anyway. So far, half way through the opening I have sold a little over four hundred pounds of fish.

The company that is buying the fish I catch will sell you one of them in Yakutat for something over four dollars a pound. They have to get my fish up to Yakutat and they are selling a dressed fish but...

On a brighter side I dodged a couple of bullets today. The first on was on the river. One of my nets got caught up in a tree on the bottom. No amount of tugging could loosen the lead line from the tree's grip. I hooked the net up to the boat and backed away from the tree hoping the line would pull free. Nope. Then I got a running start with the boat thinking that would pop the line loose. Nope. All that did was cause water to pour over the transom into the boat. The solution was to cut the lead line on both sides of the invisible net eating monster and recover the balance of the net.

The second bullet had to do with the trailer I pull behind the Honda. These tough little trailers are built to carry the totes we haul the fish, firewood, groceries, packages and people in. From time to time the last couple of days it seemed the trailer wanted to pull the Honda to the side as we motored along. Checking it out this evening found one of the wheels was about to fall off. The bearing was shot. Not a problem though. That trailer has a twin in the side yard and I think I have a new hub and bearing in the workshop.

Hoping to beat the seals to any fish that were in the nets I was on the river around five this morning. The seals stole two. I may sleep in a little longer tomorrow.

Part of yesterday was spent repairing the net I tore up last week.  When I’m doing that sort of thing I am reminded of the little spider that has a web in the corner of the kitchen window.  Whenever I open that window it damages the web.  In just a couple of minutes that spider is back out there repairing the damage.  I have watched this happen a couple of times.  I wish I was one tenth as good at repairing my nets as that spider is.

Commercial fishing happens again tomorrow.  I took the repaired net back over to the boat, reattached the bridals, buoys and anchors. Then I spread the net out on the river bank.  Tomorrow all I have to do is pull the net out into the water.

On the way over this mom and her two cubs were across the slough.  I had seen them earlier this year.  The cubs look almost twice as big as they were a few weeks ago.

1419,3,2015-07-16 16:18:01,2015-07-17 00:18:01,"A quiet couple of days here at the cabin. It has rained gently off and on.  On and off.  Off and on.  Not hard enough to keep the swallows from darting about catching bugs. Not hard enough to keep the hummingbirds away from the feeder. Hard enough keep Louis and this old guy close to home. The forecast for tomorrow is: rain, heavy at times. I finished two novels this week. It might be three if the forecast is correct.

Some visitors came through yesterday. Tanya, the Glacier Bay bear biologist and her seasonal helper Christian, stopped by for a visit. It is always informative talking with them. They are both musicians and tonight if it isn't raining they will they will entertain the community.

The flying service I have used getting in and out of here landed out front yesterday afternoon. Paul offers a variety of trips in his beautiful plane. He will take you on a flight that includes landing on a glacier. He will take you through the mountains for amazing photography opportunities. He will even take you into the outback and land on a remote beach. One of those remote spots is here in front of the cabin. His clients yesterday were from Alaska and Michigan.

Got a compliment of sorts today. Wildflower, the man I fished with last year, asked me if I would be interested in fishing with him again next year. I thanked him and said I thought that would be fine. Wildflower and I were born just 9 days apart. He is the older one. We discussed how the decades have changed our energy levels. Him more so than me cause he is so much older.

The Fish and Wildlife people published an announcement today that the East Alsek river will be open for two days fishing next week. The East Alsek is the river just outside my cabin. Most of us will continue to fish the Alsek River which is about five miles away. There is one fisherman who will fish the East.

1424,3,2015-07-18 20:19:59,2015-07-19 04:19:59,"Today was indeed a unique day in my adventures here in this remote part of the world.  The bear biologist called it a false attack rather than a false charge.  That was after she had made a special trip back over to my cabin to interview me just before she was to fly out.

But as she said “Take me through it from the beginning” so I will for you.  Two nights ago the neighbors hosted a pizza party.  There were sixteen people there.  The hostess was amazing in that she could keep pulling pizzas out of that oven as fast as we could eat them.  The biologist mentioned above is also a gifted songwriter and musician.  She and her friend played several songs for us.  Some of them we could sing along to.  It was a very enjoyable evening.  One of the songs stuck in my head.  I will post those lyrics here another time.

This morning Louis and I were on our normal walk along the trail that runs along behind the cabin.  I was whistling that song that was stuck in my head.  I noticed some of the cow parsnip plants alongside the trail were mashed down.  Might have even mentioned out loud to Louis that somebody had been through here recently.

Shortly after that Louis took off up the trail at a run.  I knew there was something up there, probably a bear.  They usually crash off into the brush.  Louis then trots back to me feeling very proud.  I caught a glimpse of a small bear disappearing off to the right of the path.  The next thing I saw was a sow grizzly dropping down on all fours running right at me.  Louis was about 50 feet in front of me.  The bear ran right over him and came charging toward me.  Remembering to act big, raise my arms and make noise I did those things.  The bear stopped about eight feet from me.  She couldn’t decide what to do next.

The thought running through my mind at that instant was “how bad is this going to hurt?”.  After maybe ten very long seconds she turned around and went back past Louis to check on the cub that had disappeared to the right.  Then she turned back around.  Louis was trying to regain his footing.  She bit him just in front of his left hip and came charging back down the trail to me.  Again she stopped about eight feet away.  By now about a pint of adrenaline had entered my blood stream.  I don’t know why she decided, after another hour long few seconds, to turn away but she did.  She went back past Louis to where her cub has vanished.  She made a couple more advances toward me then moved away into the brush.

Louis has a gash on his flank that will require stiches to close.  The neighbor fisherman who is a retired veterinarian has been invaluable in administering first aid to Louis.  Tomorrow we will suture the wound closed.  A cousin in Florida recently sent me a care package containing some of Kentucky's finest bourbon.  I used that for my first aid and second aid too.

When the biologist came this afternoon she and I walked through the scene of the encounter.  She commented that it is often the dog that prompts the bear to become defensive and go into attack mode.  There was enough distance between me and the cub that the bears would probably just moved off.  But because Louis was going after the retreating cub, mama grizzly thought she needed to go into attack/defense mode.

This evening (its 7:45 now) Louis has eaten as normal and is resting.  There are still about four ounces of adrenaline circulating through my veins.  I’m worried about how a fourteen year old dog can handle this but we are doing the best we can under the circumstances.

Late this afternoon a sow and twin cubs passed by.  I bet it is the bears we encountered this morning.  Louis and I have walked along that trail probably three hundred times the last two years.  We have seen a few bears.  Nothing like today though.  From now on I will carry some bear spray.  If it doesn’t deter the bear maybe the pepper in the spray will make me taste better.

Commercial fishing was limited to one day on the Alsek River.  The East Alsek was open for two days.  Nobody caught lots of fish but most of us caught a few.  The water level in the Alsek was higher than normal this week.  I have been fishing in a slough behind three other nets set out by Wildflower.  That usually means I catch about 20% of what he does.  This week because of the higher water we were almost even at around 60 fish each.

Sport fishing was another story.  Sockeye are hard to catch with sporting equipment.  Not yesterday.  A few weeks ago I broke one section of my fly rod while landing a fish.  The new section arrived and the fish seem to love the replacement.  I caught the limit in a couple of hours.  Feeling smug I invited the other guys fishing to come by the cabin for dinner last night.  We had one of the fish prepared with a brown sugar and chili powder rub.  It was delicious.

When we stepped outside this morning Louis went on alert.  The wolf was back.  I believe it is an adolescent.  When the wolf saw us it stopped and its body language seemed to be saying to Louis “want to play”?  I suggested to Louis that might not be a good idea.  The wolf got the hint and moved on off.

A few nights ago the bear biologist and her assistant entertained our little community with their acoustic instruments and beautiful voices.  One song Tania sang for us was called “THE SWELL”.  The melody has been in my head ever since.  I asked her for the lyrics.  If you’ve been out on the ocean or from the beach watched the sea, I hope these words inspire you the way they have me.

<em><strong>The Swell</strong></em>

<em>by Tania Lewis</em>

<em>I am a poor girl from the Midwest, when I was younger I took a trip west,</em>

<em>I saw the ocean crash to the shore, and knew from that moment that I wanted more,</em>

<em>In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.  In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>Then you came to me, and taught me to sail, and when to row harder and when not to bail,</em>

<em>Now you give me courage and you give me hope, riding the waves in our little boat,</em>

<em>In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.  In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>Now you got the cooler and I got the poles, we’re anchored together at our fishing hole,</em>

<em>We’ll lay our sleeping bags out on the deck, and kiss and give thanks for this sweet life we get,</em>

<em>In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.  In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>Now if you sail west, for an hour or two, you’ll feel the ocean begin to rock you,</em>

<em>Don’t be worried and don’t be afraid, it’s just the love that the wind and moon made,</em>

<em>In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.  In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.</em>

<em>In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.  In the swell, in the swell, in love I fell.</em>

That licking his wound resulted in the stitches coming out and today he had to be sedated again. Another trip to the top of the stove. This time Dr. Perry used 20 pound monofilament fishing line to sew him up.

The interior stitches had held and he is healing but the external stitches holding his skin together failed. With this heavy duty ""thread"" his licking the incision won't degrade the closure.  We have also fabricated a collar that hopefully will keep him from reaching the incision.

Almost all the fishermen have abandoned the Alsek River to fish over here by the cabin in the East Alsek River. I'm staying over on the Alsek for this week anyway.

There has been an ongoing stress when it comes to having propane tanks and fuel drums refilled. If the fishing doesn't improve the fish buyer will pull out of Dry Bay.

Many of the fishermen moved over to the East Alsek River from the Alsek. In the past this time of the season fishing declines on the Alsek and is about prime time to fish the smaller East river. As a result I had my choice of previously ""good"" sets over on the Alsek.

A couple of unexpected things happened. First the weather went south in a big way. The wind was blowing hard and steady rain was falling on the East River. The water was white capped and controlling the boats while tending the nets made a hard enough job even harder. The steady rain fell where I was fishing but my sets were sheltered from the wind. More good fortune followed my not moving my gear. I caught several fish while the men that moved and had to fight the elements caught fewer fish than they had hoped. The last bit of good fortune is that the Fish and Wildlife petrol decided to leave the Alsek River open to fishing two more days. The East Alsek River was closed at noon today.

When the chips fall like they did this week it is no wonder they call it fishing and not catching.

I must be gradually evolving into the life patterns required here at the cabin. There is still plenty to do around here but some of the chores I just don't want to do. Like replacing the insulation in the ceiling. I'd rather do something .. anything else. Maybe we, Louis and I, should evolve and take a trip.

The weather has finally cleared up. This month we have had 18.72 inches of rain. 27.65 inches since the first of May. The rain caused me to not even fish the third day this week. This morning the Vet and I went over to the harbor and brought the nets and boat home. There is a slight chance I will set a net for the silver salmon when they come into the East river but there is no commercial market for them here at Dry Bay and I think the freezer at home is nearly full. Maybe I'll ask a neighbor to check and see how much room is left. There are about twenty sockeye in the freezer here. Most of them are smoked.

Tried an new smoking recipe. One cup of salt, two cups of brown sugar, two cups of white sugar. Lay the fish between layers of the salt/sugar and let that sit over night, rinse well then put them in the smoker as usual. I did that. I can't really tell much difference in the taste with this method and what I have been doing with just salt. Anyway there are fifteen pounds more smoked salmon in the freezer.

The Alaska State Fair is going on this week down in Haines. I thought some folks from Yakutat might be going down to see the sights. If that happened then maybe I could hitch a ride back down to Haines on the empty plane when the folks from town came home. Not to be this year. Nobody chartered a plane to go to the fair. Another way to get to Haines on the cheap would be to fly down with a group of rafters who have come off the Alsek River. The charter service informed me those flights are all full because the ten to fourteen day raft trip requires so much gear the plane is always full. The third option might work out.

The good folks at Mountain Flying Service have hauled Louis and me in and out of here the last two years. After contacting them it looks like there might be a way to get down there. If that happens Louis and I are going to hop in the camper and become wanderers over in the middle of this huge state. We might go to Fairbanks with lots of stops in between. We might end up in Valdez on the Prince Williams Sound. We might go to Dawson City in the Yukon and drive the Top of the World Highway. We hope the weather holds and Paul can fly his beautiful deHavilland DHC-2 Beaver over here to get us. We would need to be back by the first of September. The silver salmon should be in the river by then and with them world class sport fishing. Sportsmen from Europe come here to fish just out my front door.

Every time I run into the Vet, aka Dr. Perry, I quickly run out of words trying to express my gratitude for his saving Louis. Between the surgery and the antibiotics he gave us the old dog seems to be doing just fine. I might pick up something special for him on our trip. I am so tempted to type something very tacky here but just imagine what us two old guys might come up with for entertainment. It probably wouldn't be a DVD of Billy Graham's best sermons.",July 30,,publish,open,open,,july-30,,,2015-07-31 05:22:19,2015-07-31 13:22:19,,0,http://www.notesfromalaska.com/?p=1450,0,post,,2

I must be gradually evolving into the life patterns required here at the cabin. There is still plenty to do around here but some of the chores I just don't want to do. Like replacing the insulation in the ceiling. I'd rather do something .. anything else. Maybe we, Louis and I, should evolve and take a trip.

The weather has finally cleared up. This month we have had 18.72 inches of rain. 27.65 inches since the first of May. The rain caused me to not even fish the third day this week. This morning the Vet and I went over to the harbor and brought the nets and boat home. There is a slight chance I will set a net for the silver salmon when they come into the East river but there is no commercial market for them here at Dry Bay and I think the freezer at home is nearly full. Maybe I'll ask a neighbor to check and see how much room is left. There are about twenty sockeye in the freezer here. Most of them are smoked.

Tried an new smoking recipe. One cup of salt, two cups of brown sugar, two cups of white sugar. Lay the fish between layers of the salt/sugar and let that sit over night, rinse well then put them in the smoker as usual. I did that. I can't really tell much difference in the taste with this method and what I have been doing with just salt. Anyway there are fifteen pounds more smoked salmon in the freezer.

It was becoming routine casting and catching fish.  Then it stopped.  Using the same fly.  Standing in the same spot.  Casting the same way.  The fish were still out there.  What could have happened?  For about thirty minutes and probably a hundred casts I didn’t even feel a fish.  Something had changed.  Somehow while landing the last fish the line had become wrapped around the hook in a way that the fly came through the water differently.  I cut the fly off and retied the fly.  I caught two fish on the next two casts.

A beautiful day here.  A chill in the air this morning.  It was 42 when I got up.  An 11.2 foot high tide last night and a west wind yesterday made me think it might be a good morning to go beachcombing.  There were no man made treasures out there for me but nature left some images for me to enjoy.

A pair of wolves preceded me down the beach.  One big one, one not so big.

On the way back to the cabin I had to stop and marvel at the beauty of this place.  It is so pristine.  An eagle watching the surf for some morsel to wash in.  The pair of wolf tracks….symbols of wildness.  A 15,000 foot peak with glaciers on her flanks.  How lucky can one be to have that all to oneself early in the morning on the last day of July 2015?

The drive from Dalton City, Yukon to Fort McPherson, North West Territory is about four hundred miles. Three hundred sixty of them are on gravel road. Most of the road way was smooth and wide. There were a few places where that description did not apply. Especially when you were meeting a 30 wheeled tractor trailer (double trailers) on a curve with pot holes six inches deep. That only happened once. The solution of course is to slow down. On the first part of the trip it is nearly two hundred miles between services (gas).

The main goal today was to cross the Arctic Circle. Tonight we are camped about 75 miles above there. Most of the day was beautiful. The information at one of the roadside rest stops mentioned you could easily see over a hundred miles up the valley. That was the case most of the drive. Huge, HUGE, valleys stretched away on either side of the road. The tundra looks like the fairways on a golf course. Par for some of those holes would be in the thousands.

Another ferry crossing took us to within a few miles of Fort McPherson. We pulled into the one gas station at eleven after eight local time. The station closed at eight. No problem though. We just set up camp at a Native managed campground. There are just three campers here tonight.

There were three of us on the road together. Two other men in their own trucks. I had passed them both early on the road. After that it was difficult for them to pass me because of the sometimes dense dust off the road. At the only gas station in the 360 miles we all hit there within about five minutes. I asked them if I was holding them up. The reply was ""a little bit"". So I let the, leave before me. A little farther down the road the driver that said "" a little bit"" had pulled over to help a guy headed the other way. That truck had a flat.

Nearly a century ago gold mining was a huge industry around here.  There is still quite a bit of mining going on.  Some of the stream banks are littered with rusty equipment used in the old days to extract the ore.  Now days people are going back through the mine and stream side tailings to recover what was missed first time through.  In the community of Chicken (the founders couldn't spell ptarmigan) the store where I bought gas had a variety of gold mining equipment for sale.  Everything from pans to sluce machines.  A sign on the bulletin board out front offered bulldozers for rent.

Many of the private campgrounds have showers. Most of them charge extra for showers. In some cases you have to buy tokens that are deposited in a box that starts the shower. The campground in Dawson City gave you six minutes of water for each token.

Back in Fairbanks we found a Fred Myers store. Theses stores are huge. Free wifi. A nice deli. A Starbucks. Hot breakfast. Right next door was one of those hair salons franchises. Lately Louis had been looking at me in kind of a puzzled way. I think not having a haircut or beard trim since April might have had something to do with it.

A little farther down the road we found a Home Depot. The camper needed a little maintenance. The Depot had all the things we needed. Within sight of the Depot there was one of those do it yourself car wash places. Fifteen dollars of tokens later we pulled out of there with a truck and camper several pounds lighter. I don't think the bugs on the front of the truck weighed that much but the stones, gravel and mud in the wheel wells did.

Fairbanks also hosts several McDonalds restaurants. Lunch for me was one of their new sirloin burgers with fried onions and mushrooms. Louis got two of their dollar meal cheeseburgers.

Leaving Fairbanks behind heading toward Denali National Park we were in no hurry to find a place to spend the night. Mount McKinley, 20,320 feet high, is the highest peak in North America. Denali draws people from all over the world to her scenery and wildlife viewing opportunities.

One campground sign along the way said ""take the next left"". We did and about two miles later on a narrow gravel road we pulled into a family's yard. Five beautiful small children ran out to see who the visitor was. Apparently we turned left too soon. The actual campground was a little farther along. It was cramped and full of campers so we kept going.

Farther down the road we found the perfect spot. Widely spaced camp sites among beautiful white trunks of burch trees. Louis could run free on the airstrip adjacent to where we parked. The owner was doing some work nearby and we struck up a conversation. He is building a storage building for some of his equipment. I am envious of all his ""toys"". He had been operating a small bulldozer. There was a backhoe parked near by. Some big tracked machine with an auger attached for drilling holes in the ground was off to the side. In another shed was a bush plane, on wheels. There were floats beside the plane he could attach if there was a need to land on a lake. The walls of the gift shop/office were lined with mounted big game animals and other Alaska critters he had taken over the years. This man and he is wife spend the winters in Central America where they have another home. For an outdoors man he seemed to have it all EXCEPT a good place to fly fish for salmon. ( imagine a big smile on my face here ). We hit it off really well. He and his wife came over to the camper and we shared a drink, some snacks and great conversation.

We tried catching grayling again. No luck.

Just the other side of Gllenallen is the visitor center for the Wrangell Saint Elias National Park. It was worth the stop. I bought the movie they show describing the park. One detail mentioned in the movie is the park is larger than Switzerland and the mountains are higher.

The Chilkoot Lake state park is where I am staying again tonight.  Pink Salmon are migrating up out of the river that drains Chilkoot Lake.  There are so many fish I couldn't resist going into town and buying an inexpensive rod and reel which I promptly broke.  It was not heavy enough for the salmon.  It was designed for trout.  I took it back to the store and upgraded to a heavier outfit.

It seldom took more than five casts to catch one.  Several times I would hand my rod to a person watching and let them bring the fish in.  This morning a lady from China who was on the cruse ship kept one of the fish.<a href=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image26.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1511"" src=""http://www.notesfromalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image26-300x224.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""300"" height=""224"" /></a>

At still another park at the end of the road outside Juneau the chum salmon were spawning.  Here a pair are doing what comes naturally when spawning.

In Sitka there is a raptor rescue/preserve.  These three have been injured in the past and can't fly. Whenever possible the birds are returned to the wild.  The tour guide mentioned the ages of some of their resident birds.  One owl had been there 28 years.

We had to get in line to board the ferry to Haines

at three this morning.  The dog sled rides on the glaciers above Juneau are over for the season so the mushers were taking their dogs north.  This rig holds about 75 dogs.  These people were moving 124 dogs in two rigs on this trip.

Driving a little slower the truck got 13.5 miles per gallon of fuel. At one of the weigh stations I asked the operator if I could drive the truck across the scale. The truck and camper together weigh a little over 9,600 pounds. The electronics in the truck said the average speed on the trip was 41 mph. To move that much weight and still get 13.5 miles a gallon I felt better about the truck.

In Haines Tuesday night we camped out at the airport. The plan was to leave at eight Wednesday morning. There were two others on the flight to Dry Bay besides Paul the pilot. Thorsten and Clay went along for the sightseeing.

Both these passengers are pilots. During the flight it was enlightening to hear them discuss flying through the mountains and how to take advantage of the terrain to avoid weather problems. Clay lives in Alaska. Thorsten lives in Switzerland. He is a 747 pilot. After they went back to Haines Thorsten flew his single engine plane back over here to Dry Bay and may stay with me a couple of days to experience life in the bush.

Through the early part of the summer a number of logs were collected for firewood. This week the plan has been to cut all those logs up into firewood lengths. (As I proof read this I realized it is a new week. It is easy to forget what day it is here). Then the hard part started. Those lengths had to be moved up to the wood shed and split into wood stove size pieces and stacked. Today that chore got completed for this season. There should be enough wood in the shed for all of next summer and maybe a little more.

While splitting the wood a hummingbird came by. Here's wishing that little guy luck in making it back to Central America before cold weather hits. Sandhill Cranes were soaring high overhead today too. Sometimes they would circle five or six times in a column of rising air before heading off toward the southeast. A mile or so later they would catch another thermal, gain some altitude and sail off again. Those birds may pass through the same country I will drive through in about a month.

The Vet is a falconer. He is trying to trap a raptor her. He is one of three people who have permission to do that this year here in Alaska. He can tell me what kind of bird of prey is flying. Y before I even see it. Went fishing after the wood project was finished. Caught the first Silver salmon of the season.

While fishing one of the raptors Mike hopes to catch, a Merlin, and a sparrow put on quite show doing aerial acrobatics. The sparrow got away but for about a minute we were awed by their maneuvers. Nearly at the same time seals were chasing salmon through the shallows on the other side of the river. All this is going on with the background in the picture below behind us.

Two days ago I drove over to the fish plant to pick up some mail. Drove a little over twenty miles. Did not see a single bear track. Did not see a single wolf track. There are very few Eagles in the neighborhood. Thinking the food is somewhere else right now. That night a bear hit all three burn barrels in the cabins here on the East River. Louis has been reluctant to walk on the train in a woods. The bear must still be around.

There have been large tides the last few days. The recent rains have the rivers full. At the mouths of the rivers there is a lot of erosion going on. Log jams that have been buried for years are washing out.

We caught several just out from the cabin. Yesterday morning the Vet and I didn't have any luck fishing near our cabins. The fish that came in yesterday kept moving upstream. After trying several places we found them again farther up than we usually fish. Today it rained all morning but I went back to the new hot spot. I was offering the fish a yellow streamer fly. No luck at all. I tied on a purple and black fly. Second cast I had a nice fish. Yesterday every fish caught was a male. Today it was about 50/50. I try and let the females go. Each of the females carry hundreds of eggs. It just seems right let them go so there will be more salmon in the years to come.

I have ten salmon in the cooler now. Tomorrow I will crank up the smoker. The plan is to can the thicker parts of these fish. The thinner cuts will just be smoked. Tonight I need to see if the gasket for the pressure cooker is still good. If it isn't good there is always plan B.....just freeze 'em.

There is a bear in the neighborhood. It is leaving its sign around. We haven't seen it but it's out there somewhere. A cow moose and her calf were out front the other morning. They are big animals. Watching them go past they move just like a horse trotting along on these long legs. They cover a lot of ground quickly.

Every year about this time the Vet has some friends fly in. They wind down their Alaska summer fishing and getting his cabin winterized. They will fly out in four days. The other neighbor known as Hazel Creek, will fly out with them. Louis and I will be the only ones left over here on the East River side of Dry Bay. There will be one couple still on the Alsek River side. I may see them, maybe not.

What this is leading up to is the sad task of getting ready to leave here myself. Paul from Mountain Air might be bringing some sport fishers over from Haines next week. If that happens we could catch a ride back with him. That would save some money. Otherwise we would have to charter a flight. About a $500 swing. There are plenty of chores left to do before I make flight plans though. Need to change the oil in both the ATVs. One of the trailers has a flat tire I should repair so I won't be faced with that next May. I might cut and split a little more wood. The new vacuum machine will need servicing before storage. We have to eat the leftovers from packages of food opened during the summer. Half a box of Hash Brown potatoes, some pasta, two boxes of cereal. And pack.

In some ways life will be simpler back in Colorado. In most ways not. In the mornings here I get up start the fire on the wood stove. Here I get the old fashioned coffee pot ready the evening before and then turn the gas stove burner on low in the mornings. By the time Louis and I get back from our walk the coffee is ready. In Boulder the coffee pot turns itself on. Here as we walk back to the cabin. Louis leading the way, we can see the smoke curling up out of the chimney. We know it will be warm and toasty inside and the coffee will be ready. In Boulder it is simpler but not as much fun.

First thing was the weather report said the sun might come out on Sunday.  If the report is correct the sun might even shin for several days next week.  If that happens the river might go down and I may be able to catch the four more fish I want to freeze.

First thing was the weather report said the sun might come out on Sunday.  If the report is correct the sun might even shin for several days next week.  If that happens the river might go down and I may be able to catch the four more fish I want to freeze.
