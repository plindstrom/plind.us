        blog.title: The Chef Movie Grilled Cheese
        blog.category: Food
        blog.summary: Anyone who has seen the movie Chef will immediately remember the grilled cheese scene. There's no dialogue; it's just bread, lots of butter, lots of cheese, and lots of love. And then some more butter.  Here's my recipe for this iconic grilled cheese!

      <p>Anyone who has seen the movie <em>Chef</em> will immediately remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbdUGdxX7ww">grilled cheese scene</a>.  There's no dialogue; it's just bread, lots of butter, lots of cheese, and lots of love.  And then some more butter.</p>
      <p>Luckily for us, the culinary consultant for the movie, Roy Choi, shared the infamous grilled cheese recipe on <em><a href="https://thechefshow.com/">The Chef Show</a></em> (a Netflix series featuring Jon Favreauav and Roy Choi).  I can confirm it is as delicious as you would expect.  There's nothing earth shattering here; instead, it is just an excellent combination of cheeses and, more importantly, a reminder to put your full attention and passion into what you are doing (even if it is just a grilled cheese).</p>
      <p>You can get <a href="https://thechefshow.com/recipes/grilled-cheese">the real recipe</a> from <em>The Chef Show's</em> web site, but this is our take on it (basically we just added even more cheese because why not).</p>
      <h3>Recipe</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Servings: 2</li>
        <li>Difficulty: Easy</li>
        <li>Ready in: 20 Minutes (5 min prep, 15 min cooking)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>4 slices sourdough</li>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 slices White cheddar or Mozzarella</li>
        <li>4 slices Yellow cheddar or American</li>
        <li>4 slices Gruyere or Swiss</li>
        <li>4 slices Parmesan or Pecorino</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Lightly oil a pan or griddle on medium low heat.  Butter one side of the bread slices and place bread into the pan butter side down.</li>
        <li>Layer cheese, divided evenly, on two of the four slices of bread.  Turn the bread without cheese over onto the cheese once it is very lightly browned.  Butter the flipped bread again.</li>
        <li>Flip the sandwich once the bottom slices are golden brown and then butter the flipped bread again.  Continue to flip so that each side gets uniformly cooked and is not overcooked.  Remove once all the cheese has melted.  Lower heat if the bread is browning too quickly.</li>
      </ol>
