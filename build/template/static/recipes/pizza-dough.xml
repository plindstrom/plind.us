    <step number="1">
      <description>Pour warm water (3/4 cup) into a small bowl and stir in the yeast.  Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about five minutes.</description>
    </step>
    <step number="2">
      <description>While the yeast dissolves, mix flour (2 cups), sugar (1 tsp) and salt (3/4 tsp) in a large bowl.  Add the yeast mixture and olive oil (3 tbsp) when the yeast has dissolved.</description>
    </step>
    <step number="3">
      <description>Mix until the dough has formed a sticky ball, then knead the dough until smooth, about one minute.  Add more flour if the dough is too sticky.</description>
    </step>
    <step number="4">
      <description>Add a drizzle of olive oil around the bowl and turn the dough in the oil to coat.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm area until doubled in size, about one hour.  Punch the dough down when it has doubled in size.</description>
    </step>
    <step number="5">
      <description>If making pizza, roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to the desired thickness.  We generally bake the pizza at 425Â°F for about 10-15 minutes, but the preparation will vary depending on what you are making.</description>
