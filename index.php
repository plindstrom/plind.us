		<p>Hello, my name is Peter and welcome to my personal web site.  When I&rsquo;m not busy at work I enjoy cooking (well, eating mostly), reading a good book, watching slightly too much TV and relaxing at home. Beyond this web site you can find me at the usual places like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pclindstrom">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

			<li>I&rsquo;m currently reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43419431-dune"><em>Dune</em></a> by Frank Herbert</li>
			<li>The weather at home is <?php echo Get_Wx(); ?></li>
			<li>When I was born <?php echo Get_Fact(); ?></li>
